## <a name='UI'></a>Ruler User Interface


The user interface is implemented in [React JavaScript Library](https://reactjs.org).

### 1. Install Node.js

[You can download node.js here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To confirm that you have node.js installed, run `node - v`

### 2. Run

```shell
cd ui
npm install 
npm start
```

By default, the app will make calls to `localhost:5000`, assuming that you have the server running on your machine. You can change the engine address in `src/actions/api.js`.

Once you have both of these running, navigate to `localhost:3000`.

**You can also try our live demo [here](http://54.83.150.235:3000).**
