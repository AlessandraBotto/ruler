To confirm that you have node.js installed, run `node - v`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
