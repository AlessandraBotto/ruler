303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

135  So underrated better<br />Than  Katy perry :/ but in not saying Katy is bad but she has no meaning to her songs. Shakira has<br />Meaningful songs these are the songs which bring memories and vibe&39;s. I will miss it.   <br />   ﻿

172  I absolutely adore watching football plus I’ve started earning income with out risk from claiming bonus deals. It’s a weird technique where you put money on something with one bookmakers and put money against it on Betfair. You acquire the bonus as income . A lad named Jim Vanstone is selecting the wagers free on his website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I have generated about 600 quid so far. And it’s free. I assume the bookmakers pay him to get new men and women, but it succeeds.

If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

58   Lamest World Cup song ever! This time FOR Africa? You mean IN Africa. It wasn&39;t a Live Aid event or something. She made it seem like a charity case for them instead of a proud moment. Where was Ricky Martin when you needed him! SMH﻿

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

58   Lamest World Cup song ever! This time FOR Africa? You mean IN Africa. It wasn&39;t a Live Aid event or something. She made it seem like a charity case for them instead of a proud moment. Where was Ricky Martin when you needed him! SMH﻿   
267  WHY DOES THIS HAVE 2 BILLION VIEWS THIS SONG IS SO ANNOYING﻿

The main character, Susan, is a CIA agent working undercover at the World Bank, and throughout the novel she struggles to balance the responsibilities of these two roles, with her personal sense of right and wrong. Susan is a strong and determined character, and I would be interested in reading more novels featuring her.I didn't know much about the situation in Somalia before reading this book, but the author has worked there, and her knowledge of Mogadishu comes through on every page to make the story feel realistic. There's a lot of detail packed in to the book, but it doesn't slow the pace (which is fairly relentless).",,22.0,,,,,0.63875,,,,,,,,,,,,24.396095433333333,Ruler,sentiment,p1,amazon,3.0,"[{'id': '2_384', 'start_offset': 13, 'end_offset': 22, 'label': 'GPE', 'explanation': 'Countries, cities, states'}, {'id': '9_384', 'start_offset': 54, 'end_offset': 61, 'label': 'GPE', 'explanation': 'Countries, cities, states'}, {'id': '28_380', 'start_offset': 159, 'end_offset': 164, 'label': 'PERSON', 'explanation': 'People, including fictional'}, {'id': '32_383', 'start_offset': 171, 'end_offset': 174, 'label': 'ORG', 'explanation': 'Companies, agencies, institutions, etc.'}, {'id': '37_383', 'start_offset': 203, 'end_offset': 217, 'label': 'ORG', 'explanation': 'Companies, agencies, institutions, etc.'}, {'id': '53_397', 'start_offset': 299, 'end_offset': 302, 'label': 'CARDINAL', 'explanation': 'Numerals that do not fall under another type'}, {'id': '65_380', 'start_offset': 354, 'end_offset': 359, 'label': 'PERSON', 'explanation': 'People, including fictional'}, {'id': '94_384', 'start_offset': 503, 'end_offset': 510, 'label': 'GPE', 'explanation': 'Countries, cities, states'}, {'id': '111_384', 'start_offset': 591, 'end_offset': 600, 'label': 'GPE', 'explanation': 'Countries, cities, states'}]",[],716.0,23.0,2020-05-21 19:26:14.907492,,,,,,,,,ruler

430,next_text,2020-05-21 19:27:54.190622,,,,"When I first played the demo I was hooked to this game's sense of speed, sound effects, and realism. So, I went out and purchased the game. In my opinion, in order for one to get the true sense driving, the car should give that little ""kick"" when the gears are switched. That is my favorite part of the game. One aspect of the game I didn't like were the graphics. I have never seen graphics where the diagonal lines are so jaggedy. It's very frustrating. That was at 1024 x 768.

One aspect of the game I didn't like were the graphics. I have never seen graphics where the diagonal lines are so jaggedy. It's very frustrating. That was at 1024 x 768.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

178  Our Beautiful Bella has been diagnosed with Wobbler's Syndrome. There is no  way we could afford to do her MRI or surgery. She is not just a dog she is  a very special member of our family. Without the surgery we fear we will  lose her.

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

The graphics are excellent and I can keep lots of trash off the ground if I set up lots of garbage cans early in the game.There are things I didn't like about the game.

240183  I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
166286  Couldn't get enough volume from the base unit to make it usable, even in a quiet office. Handsets were staticy and echoed my voice when talking. Just didn't live up to expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.   
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!

65705   If you want fast answer to your water quality this is good for it.If you need more details don't use this. You would have to get the one that you need to send out to the lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
151003  I absolutely love this show. It will definitely be on my DVR schedule.Seems like they had some forced conversations between all the players so that they could move the story along and no one gets lost. But I feel that they could have skipped those and used flashbacks or people's interaction to tell about the relationships of these characters.                                                                                                                                                                               
377611  Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.                                                                                            
1082    I used this book for an entomology class at my college, and I think it is great! Wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already, I still didn't find it boring or tedious, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails.                                                                                                                               
339285  I have an ""ancient"" Canon S750 printer I use for printing my year end financial reports. As I use it only once a year, I would expect the ink cartridges to be fresh if purchased a few months prior to expected use of them Thus far I have not had to use them, but will shortly. The problem with any printer ink cartridge is shelf life. I have learned how to extend the life of some of the older cartidges, but as the printer gets older I may have to resort to purchasing a newer one. I commend the price of this brand.

17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
362402  I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
149248  Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
381208  Got it this week an have used it for a few days, by the second day it had fallen apart and today it does not work.

45552   I'm not going to go into the plot of FLCL, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation will yet again release another upscaled piece of garbage.The video is grainy, lines are blurry in parts and pixelated in others, partly interlaced, distinctive gradient banding, it windowed (black bars on all sides; caused by 16:10 screens, not present in 16:9 ones) so the video isn't even 1080 by 4x3 standards, etc. See my comments on page 3 for screenshots, as well as the above image section.This honestly is not worth your time or money, especially if you own the DVDs already. You will get the same quality playback on your Blu-ray player with the DVDs as you would this, as most all Blu-ray players upscale DVD anyways. Buy the DVDs or don't buy it at all.This is being return the very next day as it is pure garbage. I really wish Funimation had their licences pulled for making these terrible releases.

If you like turtles, this is the ring for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
325039  I'm hacked at Home Depot that they would sell a one-of-a-kind product (Black & Decker Firestorm 15.6v product) created specifically for Home Depot and then discontinue support. Now, replacement batteries are diffcult to find - thankfully, not impossible.This battery works perfectly - hopefully, it will last a long, long time.                                          
116905  this book give you some great ideas. it will lead you to the right path on your journey to good healthy hair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
368691  I have been taking this for a few weeks now with no side effects. Not sure how much or if it is actually helping but it's sure worth a try and its natural.

292001  i thought this was a good book...but the ending was such a let down! i guess i really wanted more substance. it built up and up and up, then dropped you like a lead balloon. the characters were a bit on the sappy side. i liked the basic plot of the story, but i think it could've been written better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
381610  I was very excited to see the movie adaptation of this book. The book it was based off of was a great read that depicted one man's testimony of his growing relationship with God. This Dvd was nothing like the book's story. The directors/producers completely changed the storyline and characters. The majority of the movie was not from the book and portrayed a negative view of Christianity with some political influence as well, which was not necessary. I'm very disappointed at this entire portrayal of Donald Miller's book because it was nothing like it. It was only at the very end scene that I caught a glimpse of how the actual book was. I ask that you please read the Blue Like Jazz book before seeing this film.   
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
161949  As a traditional coffee mug It Is fine,but for travel It Is terrible. You have to be careful when you fill It that the liquid Is not too high In the mug. The top protrudes Into the mug so when you ""lock"" It In, It makes the liquid overflow. Tossed the lid and use It as a regular coffee mug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
287163  the worst aspect about these headphones is the fact that they are huge (13.5mm), which should deliver alot of bass but they manage the same sound as regular airport headphones. ...yea. the sound is alittle washed out. they dont fit well, they slip down half an inch (i bought them because i thought the clips meant they wouldnt slip but its just to keep them from falling out of your ear, they slip all the time). deserves no stars, i had to give it one. peice of junk.my personal favorite earbuds are sony MDR-ED12LP because they have the heaviest and deepest bass of any earbuds i've tryed and they sound crisp and clear.another good pair with volume control is sony MDR-E829V.

325321  David Houston was truly one of a kind. I own all his albums and he is truly a legend in country music. Love this CD!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
179754  The keurig b60 special edition brewing system was purchased as a gift and the person receiving it was very satisfied with the product and how it functioned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
287996  If you like cookingthis is a cook book.Lays flat and stay sput, just there on the table.Never needs rechargeing like thse awlful iCrappy things.There are no distracting games to makeit crash and burn. and best of all it is easy to read in bright light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
113145  I've played the demo and eagerly await the release this month. Having played Shogun, Medieval, and Viking Total War, this is a huge improvement (to an already excellent series of games). The graphics level is amazing. You can zoom in and see very detailed individual soldiers at eye level, grass swaying in the wind, etc. Watching the war elephants rip through enemy infantry was a treat. The battle interface was a little weird, being used to the Medieval TW interface, but I think it will do nicely.   
63099   Loop were one of the really potential big things back then. This CD is absolutely fantastic and really is a classic in noisy rock...

240183  I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
23983   I read Atlas Shrugged after THOROUGHLY enjoying The Fountainhead. I find Ayn Rand's philosophies engaging; however, I was disappointed in this book for several reasons:1. This book clearly needs editing -- themes were repetitious and the book is unnecessarily lengthy2. Characters were one-dimensional -- either good or evil3. Scenarios were somewhat unrealistic -- almost too fantastic to believeIn short, there are some insightful lessons to be learned from Atlas Shrugged. My recommendation is to skip this book and go straight to The Fountainhead.   
233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                            
100687  My 1G Attache worked fine for a couple of months of very light use and then suddenly Windows reported that it was ""write-protected"". I can not find any way to unprotect it and I can not find any way to contact PNY technical support. I will have to try the method described above.

375078  This book is on my very short list of ""I wish I had been smart enough to write this book"" books. It is incredibly clever and imaginative. There really is no genre for this book. It is stand alone - in a class of its own. I highly, highly recommend reading it. If I were to write my own recommended reading list, this book would be very near to the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
206781  Product was as advertised and arrived on time. The groves in the mat are pretty deep, and therefore a little more difficult to clean out, but they do trap dirt and water which is what a floor mat should do,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
58940   Loretta Lynn is a wonderful lyricist and melody maker. Each song is infused with her own wit and realism. Although her husband brought her ""out"" into the world: Had it not been for talent, there would have been nothing to bring out. This is a classic album of her talent and will either send you on a trip down memory lane, or give you the start of a new street. Great job Loretta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
245780  This CD is wonderful. The contemporary style and delivery of these self-written tunes is GREAT. I really think her sound captures a gospel version of Aniter Baker yet better. This girl is truly BAD yall! This CD is a MUST HAVE! I am excited about what's yet to come from this wonderfully anointed singer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10941   It's now June, and the kids have watched this video twice this week. Even the baby is learning how to say, ""Elmo ssss Cismis"", so I have to say this video is still a hit in my house.I found the repetitive theme song a bit irritating, but then again, this video was never intended to please me. The younger kids really like it.The story itself is rather good -- Elmo wants every day to be Christmas, and so, with a bit of magic, he gets his wish. And then we get to see what it's like to have Christmas EVERY day.This would be a good ""after Christmas"" video, I think. Of course, you might not want to still be watching it in June...

326735  Some of the instructions are not very clear. Such as, what time frame can you take the dose, especially if you miss the dose at the time you eat your meal (up to 30 mins. before or 30 mins. after, 1 hr. before, 1 hr. after, etc.). It is not clear on the product or the information that is sent or on the website. When Alli first came out, I went through a screen test on the internet and according to my answers I gave, I was a candidate. However, now, it appears, due to my diet and the amount of weight I need to lose(less than 20lbs), Alli is better left to those who need to lose at least 35lbs or more. I am sticking with it because I think it helps me stay on track with my diet, and I have seen results. However, I cannot say that all of my results are due to Alli.   
369099  i went through 2 in about 5 months but the 18 inch crash ride wen used as a ride cymbal has lasted me about a year and a half with only 1 small crack that hasnt grew and my hi-hats still sound that same way as when i took them out of the box same with m 16 inch zbt crash.....the only cymbal from the zbt line i hate is the 14"" if u want a good cymbal for a cheap price buy the 16"" the 14 "" failed miserably                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
321410  I only managed 4 chapters. I write this because I disagree with the other negative reviews about the most fundamental problem with the novel. The chapters I read consisted almost entirely of thumbnail biographical sketches of a bunch of characters, none of whom was interesting. The lack of interest was almost beside the point. A novel should not require this much ""set up"" at the onset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
32117   Ordered 2 of these headphones just weeks ago for use with iPod when working out and running. First one stopped working within days. Second one has been ok so far, but not a high quality product. At least it stays in the ears and on the head while running.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

277247  I am very familar with the work of Ms. Davis and her counter part, Ms. Bass. Collectively they have done significant damage to the field of trauma treatment with their ""checklists"" of symptoms of sexual abuse and statements such as ""if you think you've been abused, you probably have been."" Together they layed the groundwork for the ""False Memory Foundation"" with their irresponsible and ill conceived formulations.

9023    My wife always had issues while cleaning my stainless steel thermos that I take to office filled with coffee. The opening is so small that washing it becomes a pain. The other day she was telling me about the OXO good grips bottle brush; she is able to clean my thermos without any worry. The bristles are soft yet firm on the base and side walls that it does not leave any scratch. Even after repeated use the brittles remain firm and have not lost its shape. The handle has a decent grip and despite using with soap does not slip. The length is also pretty convenient for cleaning elongated bottles. It is a must have in any household.   
377768  I am a huge Beatles / Wings / McCartney fan but I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I was in this CD. Is Paul over the musical hill? Did his failed marriage put him in a dark place? Does he overestimate his musical ability because he's Paul McCartney? I'm amazed that he put out a CD that shouldn't even be considered in the same breath with his other works. I know he doesn't need the money. Then why?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
55779   A shallow story by a shallow deceiver: this book by itself isn't worth the time. I intentionally read this back-to-back with ""The Collapse of Barings"" by Stephen Fay (but one of the other available accounts would have done as well). Neither author recounts the actual account manipulations by Leeson nor the Japanese market situation leading into this time frame. So at least a third book is needed to round out the picture, such as _The Bubble Economy_ by C. Wood (1992). The message seems to be that we are awash in globalized Big Money and globalized Big Crooks! It's 10 p.m. Do you know where you savings and investments are?

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
319222  I'm quite disappointed with this video: the routine itself is okay (though nothing outstanding), BUT the instructor P.J.O'Clair (who is not the one on the cover b.t.w.) talks throughout the WHOLE video with about TWICE the speed you'd normally speak with - this was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the actual yoga at all. I mean, who can do yoga if someone talks to them ALL THE TIME?!I just can not.There is an option on the DVD to just listen to the music, but that didn't make sense for me either as I missed the transitions into the next pose when I wasn't looking at the screen (like in down dog). Additionally the music was enervating as well because it consists of a short piano sequence that is repeated from the beginning to the end of the routine :-(...(and everytime you put the DVD into the player you have to watch the introductory advertisement again!)conclusion: unusable for me & my first and last video from Stott     
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
43487   While not being a terrible, this is no Dokken album. Even though by listening to it, you might think it sounds like them. Upon further inspection, you will notice the absence of George Lynch. There are only a couple tunes I like. ""Give It Up"" & ""Mirror Mirror"". The latter being the only single from the album. If you are looking for a great Dokken CD after ""Back For Attack"", go straight for ""Erase The Slate"". Don't bother with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
362063  Sappy and soporific, this attempt at seriocomic film noir is like a nightmare that rambles senselessly hither and yon, engulfing the viewer in a morass of near surreality of silliness! One could well imagine Abbott and Costello showing up at any moment!Why Deanna Durbin's comedic and musical talents were plastered onto such a plot is a mystery, especially since the story spasmodically struggles to rise above the manic stooginess of it all. Some of the actors actually manage to perform unscathed by the flakiness--particulary Dan Duryea, who serves as a painful reminder of what the film could have been. Most, however, are utterly wasted--including a white cat lugged listlessly about by one villain. One waits eagerly for the mere prop of a puss to spring from its human's arms and guide the plot to a providential turn. But, alas!                                                                                                           
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.                                                                             
262742  While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
362402  I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
292001  i thought this was a good book...but the ending was such a let down! i guess i really wanted more substance. it built up and up and up, then dropped you like a lead balloon. the characters were a bit on the sappy side. i liked the basic plot of the story, but i think it could've been written better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
362499  My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
85389   I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
146333  As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?                                                                                                                                                                                                 
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5310    The book does not focus on the ""Scientific and technical"" side (only 1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters 1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10, 11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists.                                                                                                              
284309  It's my personal oppinion, and I believe from anyone in my country, or whoever made the big mistake of buying this book, and already know a lot of Bolivia, more than this simple guy who only travel to my country seeking for get drunk any day, that you will hate the way he see my country, and talk about it.Also, I never heard, and I know a lot of Bolivian history, that we had 16 COnstitutions and 250 governments, whoever was his guide, or his informer... wasn't good at allIf you really want to know about Bolivia, you will skip this story about his trip,that tell us about him acting like a burglar as any american does in my country.I hope this writer read my review, and think about his career, because is not a writer for sure, just a lier.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
376140  I wanted to like this book. But I didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I hate it when the heroes are unable to trust each other, to talk and understand each other. Here, the heroine simply assumes the worse and flees. Yeah, that shows her love. A real disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
46383   I can't figure out for the life of me why they would make this item with such large top part that fits exterior doors. I couldn't use this in my bathroom because I have standard doors (1 3/8""), which means that these were too big in width at the top and kept wobbling and being very noisy, not to mention scraping the door at the bottom since the side rods weren't vertical, but at an angle towards the door. I even tried putting something to stabilize these (like bubble wrap at the top between the door and the side rails, but that didn't help at all.If they made a version of this with 1 3/8"" doors, I would buy it in an instant and probably be very happy with it. But as it stands, this is useless because I don't need towels hanging on the inside of my front door.                                                                                                                                                                               
381610  I was very excited to see the movie adaptation of this book. The book it was based off of was a great read that depicted one man's testimony of his growing relationship with God. This Dvd was nothing like the book's story. The directors/producers completely changed the storyline and characters. The majority of the movie was not from the book and portrayed a negative view of Christianity with some political influence as well, which was not necessary. I'm very disappointed at this entire portrayal of Donald Miller's book because it was nothing like it. It was only at the very end scene that I caught a glimpse of how the actual book was. I ask that you please read the Blue Like Jazz book before seeing this film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
1621    The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
333411  I bought this DVD on sale in K-Mart. After watching it for a first time I thru it straight to the garbage. The quality of the DVD was good, but the movie was really bad. It looks like they invested a lot of money to produce this movie. But it does not worth watching even one time. All jokes are silly, and the plot is stupid. The only funny moment was a scene with nuns after they gave away the problem child. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. It does not worth a dime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
170898  I have used this program for about a year and now I am stuck. I would like to change programs because of the limiting features but I can not. The program does not export clients, print lables or have useful search capablities. You would be better off to look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
53277   Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!                                                                                                                                     
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
319222  I'm quite disappointed with this video: the routine itself is okay (though nothing outstanding), BUT the instructor P.J.O'Clair (who is not the one on the cover b.t.w.) talks throughout the WHOLE video with about TWICE the speed you'd normally speak with - this was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the actual yoga at all. I mean, who can do yoga if someone talks to them ALL THE TIME?!I just can not.There is an option on the DVD to just listen to the music, but that didn't make sense for me either as I missed the transitions into the next pose when I wasn't looking at the screen (like in down dog). Additionally the music was enervating as well because it consists of a short piano sequence that is repeated from the beginning to the end of the routine :-(...(and everytime you put the DVD into the player you have to watch the introductory advertisement again!)conclusion: unusable for me & my first and last video from Stott     
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
43487   While not being a terrible, this is no Dokken album. Even though by listening to it, you might think it sounds like them. Upon further inspection, you will notice the absence of George Lynch. There are only a couple tunes I like. ""Give It Up"" & ""Mirror Mirror"". The latter being the only single from the album. If you are looking for a great Dokken CD after ""Back For Attack"", go straight for ""Erase The Slate"". Don't bother with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
362063  Sappy and soporific, this attempt at seriocomic film noir is like a nightmare that rambles senselessly hither and yon, engulfing the viewer in a morass of near surreality of silliness! One could well imagine Abbott and Costello showing up at any moment!Why Deanna Durbin's comedic and musical talents were plastered onto such a plot is a mystery, especially since the story spasmodically struggles to rise above the manic stooginess of it all. Some of the actors actually manage to perform unscathed by the flakiness--particulary Dan Duryea, who serves as a painful reminder of what the film could have been. Most, however, are utterly wasted--including a white cat lugged listlessly about by one villain. One waits eagerly for the mere prop of a puss to spring from its human's arms and guide the plot to a providential turn. But, alas!                                                                                                           
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.                                                                             
262742  While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
362402  I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
292001  i thought this was a good book...but the ending was such a let down! i guess i really wanted more substance. it built up and up and up, then dropped you like a lead balloon. the characters were a bit on the sappy side. i liked the basic plot of the story, but i think it could've been written better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
362499  My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
85389   I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
146333  As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?                                                                                                                                                                                                 
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5310    The book does not focus on the ""Scientific and technical"" side (only 1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters 1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10, 11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists.                                                                                                              
284309  It's my personal oppinion, and I believe from anyone in my country, or whoever made the big mistake of buying this book, and already know a lot of Bolivia, more than this simple guy who only travel to my country seeking for get drunk any day, that you will hate the way he see my country, and talk about it.Also, I never heard, and I know a lot of Bolivian history, that we had 16 COnstitutions and 250 governments, whoever was his guide, or his informer... wasn't good at allIf you really want to know about Bolivia, you will skip this story about his trip,that tell us about him acting like a burglar as any american does in my country.I hope this writer read my review, and think about his career, because is not a writer for sure, just a lier.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
376140  I wanted to like this book. But I didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I hate it when the heroes are unable to trust each other, to talk and understand each other. Here, the heroine simply assumes the worse and flees. Yeah, that shows her love. A real disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
46383   I can't figure out for the life of me why they would make this item with such large top part that fits exterior doors. I couldn't use this in my bathroom because I have standard doors (1 3/8""), which means that these were too big in width at the top and kept wobbling and being very noisy, not to mention scraping the door at the bottom since the side rods weren't vertical, but at an angle towards the door. I even tried putting something to stabilize these (like bubble wrap at the top between the door and the side rails, but that didn't help at all.If they made a version of this with 1 3/8"" doors, I would buy it in an instant and probably be very happy with it. But as it stands, this is useless because I don't need towels hanging on the inside of my front door.                                                                                                                                                                               
381610  I was very excited to see the movie adaptation of this book. The book it was based off of was a great read that depicted one man's testimony of his growing relationship with God. This Dvd was nothing like the book's story. The directors/producers completely changed the storyline and characters. The majority of the movie was not from the book and portrayed a negative view of Christianity with some political influence as well, which was not necessary. I'm very disappointed at this entire portrayal of Donald Miller's book because it was nothing like it. It was only at the very end scene that I caught a glimpse of how the actual book was. I ask that you please read the Blue Like Jazz book before seeing this film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
1621    The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
333411  I bought this DVD on sale in K-Mart. After watching it for a first time I thru it straight to the garbage. The quality of the DVD was good, but the movie was really bad. It looks like they invested a lot of money to produce this movie. But it does not worth watching even one time. All jokes are silly, and the plot is stupid. The only funny moment was a scene with nuns after they gave away the problem child. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. It does not worth a dime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
170898  I have used this program for about a year and now I am stuck. I would like to change programs because of the limiting features but I can not. The program does not export clients, print lables or have useful search capablities. You would be better off to look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
53277   Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!                                                                                                                                     
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
319222  I'm quite disappointed with this video: the routine itself is okay (though nothing outstanding), BUT the instructor P.J.O'Clair (who is not the one on the cover b.t.w.) talks throughout the WHOLE video with about TWICE the speed you'd normally speak with - this was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the actual yoga at all. I mean, who can do yoga if someone talks to them ALL THE TIME?!I just can not.There is an option on the DVD to just listen to the music, but that didn't make sense for me either as I missed the transitions into the next pose when I wasn't looking at the screen (like in down dog). Additionally the music was enervating as well because it consists of a short piano sequence that is repeated from the beginning to the end of the routine :-(...(and everytime you put the DVD into the player you have to watch the introductory advertisement again!)conclusion: unusable for me & my first and last video from Stott     
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
43487   While not being a terrible, this is no Dokken album. Even though by listening to it, you might think it sounds like them. Upon further inspection, you will notice the absence of George Lynch. There are only a couple tunes I like. ""Give It Up"" & ""Mirror Mirror"". The latter being the only single from the album. If you are looking for a great Dokken CD after ""Back For Attack"", go straight for ""Erase The Slate"". Don't bother with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
362063  Sappy and soporific, this attempt at seriocomic film noir is like a nightmare that rambles senselessly hither and yon, engulfing the viewer in a morass of near surreality of silliness! One could well imagine Abbott and Costello showing up at any moment!Why Deanna Durbin's comedic and musical talents were plastered onto such a plot is a mystery, especially since the story spasmodically struggles to rise above the manic stooginess of it all. Some of the actors actually manage to perform unscathed by the flakiness--particulary Dan Duryea, who serves as a painful reminder of what the film could have been. Most, however, are utterly wasted--including a white cat lugged listlessly about by one villain. One waits eagerly for the mere prop of a puss to spring from its human's arms and guide the plot to a providential turn. But, alas!                                                                                                           
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.                                                                             
262742  While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
362402  I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
292001  i thought this was a good book...but the ending was such a let down! i guess i really wanted more substance. it built up and up and up, then dropped you like a lead balloon. the characters were a bit on the sappy side. i liked the basic plot of the story, but i think it could've been written better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
362499  My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
85389   I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
146333  As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?                                                                                                                                                                                                 
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5310    The book does not focus on the ""Scientific and technical"" side (only 1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters 1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10, 11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists.                                                                                                              
284309  It's my personal oppinion, and I believe from anyone in my country, or whoever made the big mistake of buying this book, and already know a lot of Bolivia, more than this simple guy who only travel to my country seeking for get drunk any day, that you will hate the way he see my country, and talk about it.Also, I never heard, and I know a lot of Bolivian history, that we had 16 COnstitutions and 250 governments, whoever was his guide, or his informer... wasn't good at allIf you really want to know about Bolivia, you will skip this story about his trip,that tell us about him acting like a burglar as any american does in my country.I hope this writer read my review, and think about his career, because is not a writer for sure, just a lier.                                                                                                                                                                                                     
376140  I wanted to like this book. But I didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I hate it when the heroes are unable to trust each other, to talk and understand each other. Here, the heroine simply assumes the worse and flees. Yeah, that shows her love. A real disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
46383   I can't figure out for the life of me why they would make this item with such large top part that fits exterior doors. I couldn't use this in my bathroom because I have standard doors (1 3/8""), which means that these were too big in width at the top and kept wobbling and being very noisy, not to mention scraping the door at the bottom since the side rods weren't vertical, but at an angle towards the door. I even tried putting something to stabilize these (like bubble wrap at the top between the door and the side rails, but that didn't help at all.If they made a version of this with 1 3/8"" doors, I would buy it in an instant and probably be very happy with it. But as it stands, this is useless because I don't need towels hanging on the inside of my front door.                                                                                                                                                                               
381610  I was very excited to see the movie adaptation of this book. The book it was based off of was a great read that depicted one man's testimony of his growing relationship with God. This Dvd was nothing like the book's story. The directors/producers completely changed the storyline and characters. The majority of the movie was not from the book and portrayed a negative view of Christianity with some political influence as well, which was not necessary. I'm very disappointed at this entire portrayal of Donald Miller's book because it was nothing like it. It was only at the very end scene that I caught a glimpse of how the actual book was. I ask that you please read the Blue Like Jazz book before seeing this film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
1621    The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
333411  I bought this DVD on sale in K-Mart. After watching it for a first time I thru it straight to the garbage. The quality of the DVD was good, but the movie was really bad. It looks like they invested a lot of money to produce this movie. But it does not worth watching even one time. All jokes are silly, and the plot is stupid. The only funny moment was a scene with nuns after they gave away the problem child. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. It does not worth a dime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
170898  I have used this program for about a year and now I am stuck. I would like to change programs because of the limiting features but I can not. The program does not export clients, print lables or have useful search capablities. You would be better off to look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
53277   Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!                                                                                                                                     
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

97587   I must say PM(Redux) is the the best sounding of all the prime mover projects. I own all of them and have to say I was very reluctent to buy a third copy. I took a chance and bought it anyway and was very pleased with the overall remix and recording process. If you have either of the first two cd's I would highly recommend this version, I believe you would thoughrly enjoy it!   
120865  I've had peels at the dermatologist's office before so maybe that was the problem. The strengths of these peels definitely do not compare. No tingling, no nothing. I have to step up the strength or maybe use an unbuffered version I guess.                                                                                                                                               
231506  They do not tell you that there is only 1 CD when there's supposed to be 2. If I would've known, I would've at least liked to have a choice of which CD I wanted. And $15.00 for one CD is NOT a deal afterall.                                                                                                                                                                              
12456   This was the best movie ever!!!Loved it, seen it 4 times at the movies already!!! Can't wait for the DVD to be released!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
40087   Kira Reed and the rest of the cast make this a highly enjoyable film. Usually, the Playboy Eros titles are flimsey on plot, but this one was pretty good. As usual, several hot scenes ... I'd recommend throwing away the road map and taking a ride on the Forbidden Highway.

387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.   
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
362499  My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
85389   I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
146333  As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?                                                                                                                       
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
376140  I wanted to like this book. But I didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I hate it when the heroes are unable to trust each other, to talk and understand each other. Here, the heroine simply assumes the worse and flees. Yeah, that shows her love. A real disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

97587   I must say PM(Redux) is the the best sounding of all the prime mover projects. I own all of them and have to say I was very reluctent to buy a third copy. I took a chance and bought it anyway and was very pleased with the overall remix and recording process. If you have either of the first two cd's I would highly recommend this version, I believe you would thoughrly enjoy it!                       
120865  I've had peels at the dermatologist's office before so maybe that was the problem. The strengths of these peels definitely do not compare. No tingling, no nothing. I have to step up the strength or maybe use an unbuffered version I guess.                                                                                                                                                                   
15756   Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time.   
352550  This extrodinary movie is determined and fun. To see the boys get to gather and make a statment is amazing they worked so hard and they got what they wanted. The dancing and the singing is great. And for those girls some cute guys too.                                                                                                                                                                      
40087   Kira Reed and the rest of the cast make this a highly enjoyable film. Usually, the Playboy Eros titles are flimsey on plot, but this one was pretty good. As usual, several hot scenes ... I'd recommend throwing away the road map and taking a ride on the Forbidden Highway.

387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.   
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
362499  My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
85389   I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
146333  As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?                                                                                                                       
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
376140  I wanted to like this book. But I didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I hate it when the heroes are unable to trust each other, to talk and understand each other. Here, the heroine simply assumes the worse and flees. Yeah, that shows her love. A real disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

This movie isn't realistic at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
283036  This book is full of interesting and documented survival after death and out of body experiences. The reason it didn't get 5 stars is that I did not enjoy the writing method. The book is written in a folksy kind of way that for me just didn't work all that well. The information is top notch, I would have liked it to be a little more clinical and less like you were listening to a dialogue with your great uncle.

253512  This new dvd of his is very, very funny. There are a lot of new things that he talks about in this one that he did'nt talk about in his cd or other dvd. The reason I gave it four stars is because he repeates a lot of his routines as well. But if you have never seen John Pinette preform his stand up befoe, or if you just enjoy seeing him make fun of all the classic stuff, then this dvd is freakin awsome. I enjoyed very much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
358196  While many of Hamel's writings delivered solid business roadmaps, in this book he appears to have ""crossed over"" into a world of subjectivity and exageration. This book has many ""if you don't reinvent yourself everyday"" urban myths. To read this you'd think that huge companies are becoming obsolete and going bankrupt daily. Published at the beginning of the year 2000, the book is almost obsolete by November. The idea of business concept innovation is the main theme of the book and the reader can tell that Hamel, now working in California, bought the whole dot.com story about making everyone else's business model obsolete. We now know this is nonsense and as a result the person whom the book calls ""the greatest strategist in the world"" looks rather silly as the ink still dries on his book. This book like many that have come before it, uses massive exageration to sell books. Follow the advice in this book and you too can end up like the companies featured in the book - beware.   
313249  Having been warned by some reviews, I Googled ""Original VHS"" after the film title, and found a vendor with a link to Amazon. The quality of the tape is acceptable for a used VHS, and I feel that it's preferable to a copy burned onto a DVD.As for the movie itself: although I'm not a fan of country music, I enjoyed several of the songs -- they might be described as country rock.Saving the best for last, Kristy McNichol is so-o-o cute! She deserved an Oscar just for the way she says ""Nashville, beware."" -- and there's something for everyone: the ladies will go for Dennis Quaid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
64042   This EP doesn't really represent Amorphis' style of music, but they showed that they can play other kinds of music as well. Great songs, very melodic, but NOT HEAVY METAL. If you heard one of Amorphis' earlier records (The Karelian Isthmus, Tales from the Thousand Lakes - awesome CDs) chances are you will like this, too, although the music is a very different style. Take a peek with RealAudio!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
153243  Anyone who has ever read the original ""Dracula"" NEEDS to read this fantastic retelling.Fred Saberhagen does a fine job of transforming the Count from the uncomplicated, run-of-the-mill villain he was in Bram Stoker's story into a likable anti-hero with a full-blown personality of his own. (His subtle, incredibly dry sense of humor had me giggling out loud numerous times.)Overall, this is a well thought-out, well-written, thoroughly entertaining book, with a nice touch of romance and a GREAT ending. Very highly recommended!

387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.   
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
362499  My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
85389   I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
146333  As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?                                                                                                                       
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
376140  I wanted to like this book. But I didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I hate it when the heroes are unable to trust each other, to talk and understand each other. Here, the heroine simply assumes the worse and flees. Yeah, that shows her love. A real disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

97587   I must say PM(Redux) is the the best sounding of all the prime mover projects. I own all of them and have to say I was very reluctent to buy a third copy. I took a chance and bought it anyway and was very pleased with the overall remix and recording process. If you have either of the first two cd's I would highly recommend this version, I believe you would thoughrly enjoy it!                       
120865  I've had peels at the dermatologist's office before so maybe that was the problem. The strengths of these peels definitely do not compare. No tingling, no nothing. I have to step up the strength or maybe use an unbuffered version I guess.                                                                                                                                                                   
15756   Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time.   
352550  This extrodinary movie is determined and fun. To see the boys get to gather and make a statment is amazing they worked so hard and they got what they wanted. The dancing and the singing is great. And for those girls some cute guys too.                                                                                                                                                                      
40087   Kira Reed and the rest of the cast make this a highly enjoyable film. Usually, the Playboy Eros titles are flimsey on plot, but this one was pretty good. As usual, several hot scenes ... I'd recommend throwing away the road map and taking a ride on the Forbidden Highway.

387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.   
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
362499  My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
85389   I was captivated by Whyte's first four Camulod novels (4 stars each) and was of course looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it was hands down, the most unrewarding book I've read in a LONG time. Nothing interesting at all.Merlyn and young Arthur hide in an old abandoned Roman fort (at River's Bend). They fix up the fort, Arthur grows up, Merlyn falls in love, and they hear a few rumors from back home in Camulod. That's pretty much all that happens in 461 pages.Take my advice and skip this one. His next book, SORCERER, begins with a short prologue (one and a half pages) that recaps the events of FORT AT RIVER'S BEND perfectly and saves you quite a bit of time.                                                                                                                                                                                                    
146333  As usual, the color plates are very good and the photos of equipment are plentiful. It's what one could expect from an Osprey title.However, I must state for the record that a small unit of American M1A1 Abrams tanks decimating a much larger Soviet unit is simply not credible. At NTC (Fort Irwin), the units simulating the Soviets and using simulated Soviet equipment and Soviet tactics usually win. They do so even though outnumbered and with exercises always scripted to the advantage of the blue forces.Methinks the author needed to be a little more objective lest his view of the Soviets/Russians become ""All we have to do is kick in the front door and the whole rotten ediface will fall in!"" I wonder who said that and how it turned out for him?                                                                                                                       
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
376140  I wanted to like this book. But I didn't. I couldn't even finish it. I hate it when the heroes are unable to trust each other, to talk and understand each other. Here, the heroine simply assumes the worse and flees. Yeah, that shows her love. A real disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

142582  i just had to respond to the negative reviews to plum Sykes's book. i think its absolutely hillarious - i read it in a single sitting. No, its not quantum physics but it doesn't pretend to be. It is, however, 100% entertaining and i laughed out loud throughout. Get over yourselves, haters, and set yourselves a make-out challenge!

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
319222  I'm quite disappointed with this video: the routine itself is okay (though nothing outstanding), BUT the instructor P.J.O'Clair (who is not the one on the cover b.t.w.) talks throughout the WHOLE video with about TWICE the speed you'd normally speak with - this was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the actual yoga at all. I mean, who can do yoga if someone talks to them ALL THE TIME?!I just can not.There is an option on the DVD to just listen to the music, but that didn't make sense for me either as I missed the transitions into the next pose when I wasn't looking at the screen (like in down dog). Additionally the music was enervating as well because it consists of a short piano sequence that is repeated from the beginning to the end of the routine :-(...(and everytime you put the DVD into the player you have to watch the introductory advertisement again!)conclusion: unusable for me & my first and last video from Stott     
167064  I don't know what is going on with this packaging tape, but it isn't sticky! I have gone through two rolls wrapping just a few packages because the tape doesn't stick to anything except itself. I don't know what the problem here is, but definitely DO NOT buy this product. I thought it was a fluke, but this is the second time this has happened to me ordering this product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
253087  ""Heaven:Close Encounters of the God Kind"", should be called ""I Made It All Up For The Cash"" Jesse Duplantis is another one of these flashy so-called ministers in it only for the $$$. I picked this book up because it sounded interesting, this was before I saw Jesse on TV and heard him repeatedly misquote and change the scripture. I have to say that the book is as big a joke as Jesse and will never read anything else by him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
293143  Of course, one of the main characters is a dog -- and so is this book. I really enjoy Martha Grimes' early works but this one is a huge disappointment. It's very sad -- I hope she's not written out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
33745   It is not what I expected... I am very disappointed with it!I was expecting more drawing and clear pictures...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
233450  Like others have said on here before this is NOT an HP product. It is a cheap knock off.It is better as it has an LED indicator but other than that it was much worse then my HP Original charger. This charger got much hotter then a true HP charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking AC to DC conversion very well.Wish chargers would have the 80 Plus standard that most desktops have but they don't. If they did than 80 Plus certified products wouldn't be as warm and you use less energy! I digress...Bottom line: Has an LED indicator. It chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine HP product. It may not last as long as a real charger but I have not tested that out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
245246  Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product. As I share a house with four other girls, it can be difficult to find a time to practice violin when it won't disturb anyone. I was very excited to find an inexpensively priced mute to dampen the sound. I installed it on the bridge of my instrument and ran the bow across the strings... and it sounded exactly the same. I pushed it on a bit tighter, (as tight as I felt I could put it without damaging my bridge) and it started to muffle the sound slightly, but still wasn't a great deal quieter. It seems to destroy tone quality (which was to be expected; it's a practice tool and not for performing) without making much of a difference in volume (which was the disappointment.) At least it was inexpensive, and I'm only out $5.                                                                                                                                                            
12461   Twilight the gayest thing in this world. I'm so tired of these stupid movies. Can't wait for them to end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
321410  I only managed 4 chapters. I write this because I disagree with the other negative reviews about the most fundamental problem with the novel. The chapters I read consisted almost entirely of thumbnail biographical sketches of a bunch of characters, none of whom was interesting. The lack of interest was almost beside the point. A novel should not require this much ""set up"" at the onset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
161949  As a traditional coffee mug It Is fine,but for travel It Is terrible. You have to be careful when you fill It that the liquid Is not too high In the mug. The top protrudes Into the mug so when you ""lock"" It In, It makes the liquid overflow. Tossed the lid and use It as a regular coffee mug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
374050  Just want to add to the list of failed clips. I had one of these cases as did one of my friends. Both broke at the swivel in less than a month. Nice case but defective design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
243434  I was disappointed with this dvd.To me it was too much Jerry Lee Lewis and not enough of the other singers.(I am not knocking Jerry Lee,I enjoy his country hits).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
197083  I've forgotten already what the lead character's name is, but someone who would turn their nose up at $8,000 isn't worth remembering. But, most of the characters are acceptable, except for the case of one woman who was terribly annoying. And yet, when she's taken hostage by a murderer, no one seems to be all that concerned about it, not even her family. They're more interested in finding some money. When next she's seen again, no one bothers to ask her if she's all right or anything. Apparently no one in the book cared all that much about her, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
140663  does'nt work very well; put some pieces outside, really hard to use; I need another and I don't recommand this product at all; it's not normal to sell those kind of bad products!!!!!!!!!!

4096    It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive, but that does not mean the book is super. I'm sorry, but when I read it, I did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration.The fact is that this is a so-so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so-so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original.The characters are flat, the pacing is horrid, and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little Paolini's hands. No one needs that many adjectives per sentence!Painfully generic and nothing at all special.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
43487   While not being a terrible, this is no Dokken album. Even though by listening to it, you might think it sounds like them. Upon further inspection, you will notice the absence of George Lynch. There are only a couple tunes I like. ""Give It Up"" & ""Mirror Mirror"". The latter being the only single from the album. If you are looking for a great Dokken CD after ""Back For Attack"", go straight for ""Erase The Slate"". Don't bother with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
362063  Sappy and soporific, this attempt at seriocomic film noir is like a nightmare that rambles senselessly hither and yon, engulfing the viewer in a morass of near surreality of silliness! One could well imagine Abbott and Costello showing up at any moment!Why Deanna Durbin's comedic and musical talents were plastered onto such a plot is a mystery, especially since the story spasmodically struggles to rise above the manic stooginess of it all. Some of the actors actually manage to perform unscathed by the flakiness--particulary Dan Duryea, who serves as a painful reminder of what the film could have been. Most, however, are utterly wasted--including a white cat lugged listlessly about by one villain. One waits eagerly for the mere prop of a puss to spring from its human's arms and guide the plot to a providential turn. But, alas!                                                                                                           
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.                                                                             
262742  While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
362266  This mouse worked well for me relieving pain in my arm and elbow. However the device did not last 3 months with light use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
22127   I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $25 each. The handle is actually quite good for the price and it's slightly brighter than my similar Heine (F-22.804) handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs don't last. The Heine bulbs last forever. I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets

333411  I bought this DVD on sale in K-Mart. After watching it for a first time I thru it straight to the garbage. The quality of the DVD was good, but the movie was really bad. It looks like they invested a lot of money to produce this movie. But it does not worth watching even one time. All jokes are silly, and the plot is stupid. The only funny moment was a scene with nuns after they gave away the problem child. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. It does not worth a dime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
29560   After second time going to the beach U-Lock stopped working, with luck managed to unlock after almost half an hour struggle, it useless now. Do not buy it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
355193  This lamp lasted no time. The bottom of the lamp detached from the base within a few months of not even moving the lamp-and bulbs burn out quickly and are expensive for this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
122541  Plays only on sacd players, does not have the 5.1 or 6.1 sound most SACDs have, and if you check around on the internet - the sound is not much better than a regular cd. Funny since 3 (aka Melt), 4 (aka Security) and So sound fine.Great material - but don't bother. Get the individual albums (except the first two which also sound poor in SACD format).I guess that is what you get if you come out with the new technology before most other people - it is imperfect at first. A for effort, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
370196  Have two golden retrievers. Bought this shampooer at the recommendation of the target employee. Within the first year the tank began to leak. I emailed the company and on first reply they said I could buy another one for around 40 dollars. After a less-than-nice email I received one via mail. Less than a year after that the brushes stopped spinning, conveniently after the warranty ran out. Do not buy this machine. My parents have a dirt devil and although it does not clean as well on the first go, it has lasted longer than 18 months (about 5 years) reliably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
149248  Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
156496  The new version of the diaper genie is a dramatic step backwards. Having had both, I wish I could find the older one either here on Amazon or in a store. The new one jams and shreds the plastic film 3-4 times a week, needing careful work with scissors to salvage it. It cannot be emptied the normal way, again requiring scissors. I wouldn't buy this thing again if you begged me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
170898  I have used this program for about a year and now I am stuck. I would like to change programs because of the limiting features but I can not. The program does not export clients, print lables or have useful search capablities. You would be better off to look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
197391  It was rather predictable and there was no coherant plot line, just a way to move from sex scene to sex scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
30245   If you want a phone that looks good, then this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good phone, this is not the one. The phone locks up every now and then. When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
109232  Program runs fine the first few times and then the problems begin. My files wouldn't render completely, discs would not burn, and program just locked up frequently. I am running this with PLENTY of speed and memory, so I tried re-installing the program several times with a further decline in performance. Another problem was the update from the website. When I downloaded this, my menus and title features were scattered all over my videos. After failed burning and wasting several DVD and CD's, I am no longer using this software. Save yourself the headache from the beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
250260  I bought this book to prepare my 3-year-old for preschool. While the pictures are cute and colorful, it is not written for her age (maybe for a one-yr-old). Not much content at all to explain to her what school is all about. I think we read it once or twice, and she hasn't asked to look at it again. Go with ""DW's Guide to Preschool"" instead - you won't be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
211425  Oh my god. I expected so much more from a food with 4.5 stars.This tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria. Like canned food.I couldn't even eat half a bowl, let alone a whole box!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
273906  WATCH DOES NOT MATCHING BOOK ALSO INSTRUCTIONS NOT VERY UNSTANDABLE. NOT TOO HAPPY WHEN IT ARRIVED AND DIFFERENT ON MAIN PAGE FOR AMAZON OR RETAILLER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
326735  Some of the instructions are not very clear. Such as, what time frame can you take the dose, especially if you miss the dose at the time you eat your meal (up to 30 mins. before or 30 mins. after, 1 hr. before, 1 hr. after, etc.). It is not clear on the product or the information that is sent or on the website. When Alli first came out, I went through a screen test on the internet and according to my answers I gave, I was a candidate. However, now, it appears, due to my diet and the amount of weight I need to lose(less than 20lbs), Alli is better left to those who need to lose at least 35lbs or more. I am sticking with it because I think it helps me stay on track with my diet, and I have seen results. However, I cannot say that all of my results are due to Alli.                                                                                                                                                                            
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
277392  Camera did not take good pictures indoor or outdoor, a bit blury (set to Auto of course)and yes my hand was still.Delay lag is a bit long although Nikon claims that its quick (still takes long to autofocus and then snap the shot)Bit the bullet and spent twice as much on Canon G6 and MUCH BETTER, you get what you pay for. Couple hundred more at 900 you can get Rebel G but its quite big and plastic. Liked the feel of the G6, metal, and takes great pics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
312220  I played their first three albums to death. I was disappointed by this album. The lyrics were as biting as Bob's lyrics always are, but music was not up to the level of the first three albums. The song Steve wrote was the best one on the album.I left my copy of the CD in my desk when I quit the job I was working because I knew I wasn't going to listen to it again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
365966  This watch may be comfy and stylish, but unfortunately it will become a dead piece of jewelry (bracelet) when it dies, which it will. The date doesn't reset at the end of the month, you'll have to do this EVERY MONTH and the mechanism will wear out prematurely probably as a result. Even ignoring the date function, when my watch stopped just out of warranty, the cost of repair was greater than new. Movado refuses even the basic courtesies and won't acknowledge the design flaw.There are other choices with decent warrantees. Stick with them, NOT Movado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
162924  Don't purchase this item. It's plastic with an outside coating of metal. Very cheap and not worth the cost. I purchased another product through a repeatable retailer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.

53277   Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!                                                                                                                                     
2521    This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
319222  I'm quite disappointed with this video: the routine itself is okay (though nothing outstanding), BUT the instructor P.J.O'Clair (who is not the one on the cover b.t.w.) talks throughout the WHOLE video with about TWICE the speed you'd normally speak with - this was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the actual yoga at all. I mean, who can do yoga if someone talks to them ALL THE TIME?!I just can not.There is an option on the DVD to just listen to the music, but that didn't make sense for me either as I missed the transitions into the next pose when I wasn't looking at the screen (like in down dog). Additionally the music was enervating as well because it consists of a short piano sequence that is repeated from the beginning to the end of the routine :-(...(and everytime you put the DVD into the player you have to watch the introductory advertisement again!)conclusion: unusable for me & my first and last video from Stott     
167064  I don't know what is going on with this packaging tape, but it isn't sticky! I have gone through two rolls wrapping just a few packages because the tape doesn't stick to anything except itself. I don't know what the problem here is, but definitely DO NOT buy this product. I thought it was a fluke, but this is the second time this has happened to me ordering this product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
253087  ""Heaven:Close Encounters of the God Kind"", should be called ""I Made It All Up For The Cash"" Jesse Duplantis is another one of these flashy so-called ministers in it only for the $$$. I picked this book up because it sounded interesting, this was before I saw Jesse on TV and heard him repeatedly misquote and change the scripture. I have to say that the book is as big a joke as Jesse and will never read anything else by him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
293143  Of course, one of the main characters is a dog -- and so is this book. I really enjoy Martha Grimes' early works but this one is a huge disappointment. It's very sad -- I hope she's not written out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
33745   It is not what I expected... I am very disappointed with it!I was expecting more drawing and clear pictures...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
233450  Like others have said on here before this is NOT an HP product. It is a cheap knock off.It is better as it has an LED indicator but other than that it was much worse then my HP Original charger. This charger got much hotter then a true HP charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking AC to DC conversion very well.Wish chargers would have the 80 Plus standard that most desktops have but they don't. If they did than 80 Plus certified products wouldn't be as warm and you use less energy! I digress...Bottom line: Has an LED indicator. It chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine HP product. It may not last as long as a real charger but I have not tested that out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
245246  Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product. As I share a house with four other girls, it can be difficult to find a time to practice violin when it won't disturb anyone. I was very excited to find an inexpensively priced mute to dampen the sound. I installed it on the bridge of my instrument and ran the bow across the strings... and it sounded exactly the same. I pushed it on a bit tighter, (as tight as I felt I could put it without damaging my bridge) and it started to muffle the sound slightly, but still wasn't a great deal quieter. It seems to destroy tone quality (which was to be expected; it's a practice tool and not for performing) without making much of a difference in volume (which was the disappointment.) At least it was inexpensive, and I'm only out $5.                                                                                                                                                            
12461   Twilight the gayest thing in this world. I'm so tired of these stupid movies. Can't wait for them to end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
321410  I only managed 4 chapters. I write this because I disagree with the other negative reviews about the most fundamental problem with the novel. The chapters I read consisted almost entirely of thumbnail biographical sketches of a bunch of characters, none of whom was interesting. The lack of interest was almost beside the point. A novel should not require this much ""set up"" at the onset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
161949  As a traditional coffee mug It Is fine,but for travel It Is terrible. You have to be careful when you fill It that the liquid Is not too high In the mug. The top protrudes Into the mug so when you ""lock"" It In, It makes the liquid overflow. Tossed the lid and use It as a regular coffee mug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
374050  Just want to add to the list of failed clips. I had one of these cases as did one of my friends. Both broke at the swivel in less than a month. Nice case but defective design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
243434  I was disappointed with this dvd.To me it was too much Jerry Lee Lewis and not enough of the other singers.(I am not knocking Jerry Lee,I enjoy his country hits).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
197083  I've forgotten already what the lead character's name is, but someone who would turn their nose up at $8,000 isn't worth remembering. But, most of the characters are acceptable, except for the case of one woman who was terribly annoying. And yet, when she's taken hostage by a murderer, no one seems to be all that concerned about it, not even her family. They're more interested in finding some money. When next she's seen again, no one bothers to ask her if she's all right or anything. Apparently no one in the book cared all that much about her, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
140663  does'nt work very well; put some pieces outside, really hard to use; I need another and I don't recommand this product at all; it's not normal to sell those kind of bad products!!!!!!!!!! A shame!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
64268   The item that I brought in the page said that is the correct for my car, I order and when I received the Item don't FIT to my car,the cables was very short to put in the correct side. I return the item and to today's date I don't received the refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4096    It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive, but that does not mean the book is super. I'm sorry, but when I read it, I did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration.The fact is that this is a so-so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so-so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original.The characters are flat, the pacing is horrid, and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little Paolini's hands. No one needs that many adjectives per sentence!Painfully generic and nothing at all special.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
43487   While not being a terrible, this is no Dokken album. Even though by listening to it, you might think it sounds like them. Upon further inspection, you will notice the absence of George Lynch. There are only a couple tunes I like. ""Give It Up"" & ""Mirror Mirror"". The latter being the only single from the album. If you are looking for a great Dokken CD after ""Back For Attack"", go straight for ""Erase The Slate"". Don't bother with this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
362063  Sappy and soporific, this attempt at seriocomic film noir is like a nightmare that rambles senselessly hither and yon, engulfing the viewer in a morass of near surreality of silliness! One could well imagine Abbott and Costello showing up at any moment!Why Deanna Durbin's comedic and musical talents were plastered onto such a plot is a mystery, especially since the story spasmodically struggles to rise above the manic stooginess of it all. Some of the actors actually manage to perform unscathed by the flakiness--particulary Dan Duryea, who serves as a painful reminder of what the film could have been. Most, however, are utterly wasted--including a white cat lugged listlessly about by one villain. One waits eagerly for the mere prop of a puss to spring from its human's arms and guide the plot to a providential turn. But, alas!                                                                                                           
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.                                                                             
262742  While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
362266  This mouse worked well for me relieving pain in my arm and elbow. However the device did not last 3 months with light use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
22127   I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $25 each. The handle is actually quite good for the price and it's slightly brighter than my similar Heine (F-22.804) handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs don't last. The Heine bulbs last forever. I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets

333411  I bought this DVD on sale in K-Mart. After watching it for a first time I thru it straight to the garbage. The quality of the DVD was good, but the movie was really bad. It looks like they invested a lot of money to produce this movie. But it does not worth watching even one time. All jokes are silly, and the plot is stupid. The only funny moment was a scene with nuns after they gave away the problem child. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. It does not worth a dime.

Do not buy it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
355193  This lamp lasted no time. The bottom of the lamp detached from the base within a few months of not even moving the lamp-and bulbs burn out quickly and are expensive for this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
122541  Plays only on sacd players, does not have the 5.1 or 6.1 sound most SACDs have, and if you check around on the internet - the sound is not much better than a regular cd. Funny since 3 (aka Melt), 4 (aka Security) and So sound fine.Great material - but don't bother. Get the individual albums (except the first two which also sound poor in SACD format).I guess that is what you get if you come out with the new technology before most other people - it is imperfect at first. A for effort, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
370196  Have two golden retrievers. Bought this shampooer at the recommendation of the target employee. Within the first year the tank began to leak. I emailed the company and on first reply they said I could buy another one for around 40 dollars. After a less-than-nice email I received one via mail. Less than a year after that the brushes stopped spinning, conveniently after the warranty ran out. Do not buy this machine. My parents have a dirt devil and although it does not clean as well on the first go, it has lasted longer than 18 months (about 5 years) reliably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
149248  Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
156496  The new version of the diaper genie is a dramatic step backwards. Having had both, I wish I could find the older one either here on Amazon or in a store. The new one jams and shreds the plastic film 3-4 times a week, needing careful work with scissors to salvage it. It cannot be emptied the normal way, again requiring scissors. I wouldn't buy this thing again if you begged me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
170898  I have used this program for about a year and now I am stuck. I would like to change programs because of the limiting features but I can not. The program does not export clients, print lables or have useful search capablities. You would be better off to look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
197391  It was rather predictable and there was no coherant plot line, just a way to move from sex scene to sex scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
30245   If you want a phone that looks good, then this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good phone, this is not the one. The phone locks up every now and then. When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
109232  Program runs fine the first few times and then the problems begin. My files wouldn't render completely, discs would not burn, and program just locked up frequently. I am running this with PLENTY of speed and memory, so I tried re-installing the program several times with a further decline in performance. Another problem was the update from the website. When I downloaded this, my menus and title features were scattered all over my videos. After failed burning and wasting several DVD and CD's, I am no longer using this software. Save yourself the headache from the beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
250260  I bought this book to prepare my 3-year-old for preschool. While the pictures are cute and colorful, it is not written for her age (maybe for a one-yr-old). Not much content at all to explain to her what school is all about. I think we read it once or twice, and she hasn't asked to look at it again. Go with ""DW's Guide to Preschool"" instead - you won't be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
211425  Oh my god. I expected so much more from a food with 4.5 stars.This tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria. Like canned food.I couldn't even eat half a bowl, let alone a whole box!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
273906  WATCH DOES NOT MATCHING BOOK ALSO INSTRUCTIONS NOT VERY UNSTANDABLE. NOT TOO HAPPY WHEN IT ARRIVED AND DIFFERENT ON MAIN PAGE FOR AMAZON OR RETAILLER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
326735  Some of the instructions are not very clear. Such as, what time frame can you take the dose, especially if you miss the dose at the time you eat your meal (up to 30 mins. before or 30 mins. after, 1 hr. before, 1 hr. after, etc.). It is not clear on the product or the information that is sent or on the website. When Alli first came out, I went through a screen test on the internet and according to my answers I gave, I was a candidate. However, now, it appears, due to my diet and the amount of weight I need to lose(less than 20lbs), Alli is better left to those who need to lose at least 35lbs or more. I am sticking with it because I think it helps me stay on track with my diet, and I have seen results. However, I cannot say that all of my results are due to Alli.                                                                                                                                                                            
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
277392  Camera did not take good pictures indoor or outdoor, a bit blury (set to Auto of course)and yes my hand was still.Delay lag is a bit long although Nikon claims that its quick (still takes long to autofocus and then snap the shot)Bit the bullet and spent twice as much on Canon G6 and MUCH BETTER, you get what you pay for. Couple hundred more at 900 you can get Rebel G but its quite big and plastic. Liked the feel of the G6, metal, and takes great pics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
312220  I played their first three albums to death. I was disappointed by this album. The lyrics were as biting as Bob's lyrics always are, but music was not up to the level of the first three albums. The song Steve wrote was the best one on the album.I left my copy of the CD in my desk when I quit the job I was working because I knew I wasn't going to listen to it again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
365966  This watch may be comfy and stylish, but unfortunately it will become a dead piece of jewelry (bracelet) when it dies, which it will. The date doesn't reset at the end of the month, you'll have to do this EVERY MONTH and the mechanism will wear out prematurely probably as a result. Even ignoring the date function, when my watch stopped just out of warranty, the cost of repair was greater than new. Movado refuses even the basic courtesies and won't acknowledge the design flaw.There are other choices with decent warrantees. Stick with them, NOT Movado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
162924  Don't purchase this item. It's plastic with an outside coating of metal. Very cheap and not worth the cost. I purchased another product through a repeatable retailer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.

53277   Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!                                                                                                                                     
2521    This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.

240183  I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
166286  Couldn't get enough volume from the base unit to make it usable, even in a quiet office. Handsets were staticy and echoed my voice when talking. Just didn't live up to expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.

You would have to get the one that you need to send out to the lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
151003  I absolutely love this show. It will definitely be on my DVR schedule.Seems like they had some forced conversations between all the players so that they could move the story along and no one gets lost. But I feel that they could have skipped those and used flashbacks or people's interaction to tell about the relationships of these characters.                                                                                                                                                                               
377611  Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.                                                                                            
1082    I used this book for an entomology class at my college, and I think it is great! Wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already, I still didn't find it boring or tedious, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails.                                                                                                                               
339285  I have an ""ancient"" Canon S750 printer I use for printing my year end financial reports. As I use it only once a year, I would expect the ink cartridges to be fresh if purchased a few months prior to expected use of them Thus far I have not had to use them, but will shortly. The problem with any printer ink cartridge is shelf life. I have learned how to extend the life of some of the older cartidges, but as the printer gets older I may have to resort to purchasing a newer one. I commend the price of this brand.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them.

67512   Before Johnny Dowd and the Chicago/Bloodshot guys were tearing through and tearing up the iconography of country music, there was Lee Clayton.Jet pilot turned country music singer, Clayton's straightforward, unsentimental phrasing conveys his dark, strange songs very well. He takes gospel, bluegrass and blues images and he stands them on their heads, with strong and authentic effect.These two records are an excellent introduction to a songwriter's songwriter. Buy these and you'll want more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
139097  I've owned this lens for several years now, and I've used it on both 35mm and digital SLR's. I have to start off by saying that it's a wonderful lens for the price. People who claim the lens isn't sharp might be referring to the non-APO version, which is about $100.00 less. This version, I have found, is tack-sharp between 70-200mm, and still very sharp from 200-300mm. The macro feature gives a 1:2 reproduction ratio, which is more than sufficient for most subjects. Keep in mind, on a digital camera with an APS-sized sensor, this lens is really a 112-480mm lens, taking into account the 60% crop factor. If my math isn't fuzzy, that should also make the reproduction ratio 1:1.4 on a digital SLR. That's pretty darn good for a consumer-grade lens. Sure, it's not ""L"" Series glass, but you're not paying over a grand for it, either. For someone on a budget, this lens is as good as it gets.   
68627   This is a VERY BAD remake of the original song ""Time To Say Goodbye"" by Andrea Bocelli (The version with Andrea & Sarah Brightman is the best). Being a techno lover, I find this song horrible. If you want a remix of this song in techno, get the remix by DJ Mystic. It is much better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
286339  I picked up this cd yesterday after listening to it on the headphones in a local record store. Since this is my first cd by these guys, I was totally amazed. With the exception of track 8 ""Lenny"" the rest of the tracks are jamming. These three guys are smoking on this record. This cd reminds me of 70's sounds that were coming from Herbie Hancock, Tower of Power and some early Sly and the Family Stone.Thank goodness that the Hammond B-3 organ and the clavinet are not dead instruments after all for todays young muscians. If you're a fan of the 70's Jazz Funk scene buy this cd. You will play it continuously without skipping songs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
139202  the songs that were made popular ar egreat but there are too many songs i don't know!someone should but ALL the top songs on one cd!

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down

19735   This was by far one of the best Jim Carrey movies. I laughed so hard throughout the entire thing. Jim Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates, who has a split personality. The other side of Charlie is Hank, the mean one. His personality is hilirious! It is also so funny how Charlie has three black kids that are so smart but curse all the time. You just have to see it. Anyway, if you haven't seen it I recommend it. It is a great comedy that is garaunteed to make you laugh.   
106369  This is an absulutly spectacular video! I can't wait for more tapes of the series to come out. If your a fan of Sailor Moon then I'm sure you'll love Fushigi Yugi just as much!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
86065   ""A flock of bleeps"" is as difficult to categorize as Shpongle. it's more dancefloor-oriented, but ranks right up there with ""Tales of the inexpressible"".This beautiful bit of the first song just keeps playing in my head, again and again..""You may have noticed..that I am not all there..myself!""

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price.

232308  This is a good book for someone who would like to carve a wood spirit in a walking stick or any wood. I am a beginner carver and the information was very helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
193360  *SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*This movie had quite a bit of potential...but just didn't work. The concept was quite different. But was looking for a more out of the box execution. Like finding the only possible way into a place that suppose to not be broken into(which they didn't do he just strolled on board). They shouldn't have killed all the hostages. I would have settled for snow and the girl going out of their way to get them out. And Mase!!!????...there was no need...that story line made now sense?? Maybe if they had better presented what he was doing it might have made more sense. They had at least three different story line 1.) Snow & the girl 2.) Snow & mase 3.) and a briefcase that was suppose to tie it all together. And it just didn't work. Wasn't the worst movie, but i wouldn't have gone to see it in theaters. This one is a miss.   
59388   Between GZ-I and GZ-II I cannot believe that these CD's have not had an impact in the states. These two CD's are a guitar enthusiasts dream come true. Neal Schon, Brain May, Steve Morse, Slash, Paul Gilbert, Doug Aldrich, Yngwie Malmsteen, Elliot Easton, Leslie West, Zakk Wylde, John Norum, Ted Nugent, Ty Tabor, Warren DeMartini, Dweezil Zappa, Kenji Kitajima,Vivian Campbell. The list goes on and on. The material on both CD's are TOP notch. Carmine mentioned above the amount of time and effort that he, Kelly and Tony put into these projects. I tip my hat off to them. This is excellent material. I highly recommend it. Both CD's are worth every penny. Both CD's are played frequently to and from work. For as long as Carmine and co. put out GZ CD's I'll be anxious to buy them. Thanks for your music.                                                
170254  If you're buying this for it's sunscreen protection, go right ahead. It works great for that! But if you think it will keep mosquitoes off of your skin, get something with Deet instead. I used this product for 8 days in the Spring in Kauai, Hawaii, and was seriously bitten by mosquitoes each day. I'd say I had between 3 - 8 bites a day, and some within just an hour after applying liberal amounts of this stuff all over me, even right where I was bitten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
350062  A GREAT story! A GREAT Author! I can't wait to read more by Huggins. This story has it all...mystery, suspense, action, and intrique. Top it off with a great biblical message and a true-to-life depiction of Satan's demeanor. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who likes action thrillers.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them.

49032   I liked the philosophy behind this book -- i.e., rid your body of environmental toxins consumed through non-organic foods. I think organic eating is only going to become more popular. However, I followed this diet religiously, all organic, and I lost absolutely no weight. (I should state that I am not very heavy to begin with and would only like to lose 10 pounds long-term. I was, however, hoping for a ""jump-start."") I agree with the poster who stated that she was confused regarding whether certain foods were permissible (potatoes, cheese, etc.) I did eat cheese. The fast day was difficult for me. I probably will not try this detox again, but I would recommend it to others, if only to try to promote a healthier way of eating.   
272518  With the Squirrel Stop and a chain between it and the feeder to avoid play in it.It's great!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6218    If you haven't seen it, do it now. This is a must see for anyone who loves a good laugh at any cost. From the pizza delivery guy, to Matt Dillan's teeth. You can picture yourself in any situation that occurs in this movie. Watch it with someone you love. Anyone got any hair gel?

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

25251   This is a Perfect record. How many tired bossa nova records have we all heard? This is not that. This is so sweet, so mellow, so beautiful, so perfectly paced and arranged. I was amazed when I heard it. And her voice! Remarkable. In a way her voice is deceptively normal. There are no gimmicks. So straightforward in the most simple and beautiful way imaginable. They say that if you were somehow able to morph and combine the features of the faces of every single person on Earth into one face, you would have the most normal, familiar and beautiful face you've ever seen. That's what Olivia's voice is - the most normal, familiar and beautiful voice you've ever heard.

178427  Saw it when I was a kid with my mom....it was funnier when i was a kid. Ended up giving the movie to my mom and she loves it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
49032   I liked the philosophy behind this book -- i.e., rid your body of environmental toxins consumed through non-organic foods. I think organic eating is only going to become more popular. However, I followed this diet religiously, all organic, and I lost absolutely no weight. (I should state that I am not very heavy to begin with and would only like to lose 10 pounds long-term. I was, however, hoping for a ""jump-start."") I agree with the poster who stated that she was confused regarding whether certain foods were permissible (potatoes, cheese, etc.) I did eat cheese. The fast day was difficult for me. I probably will not try this detox again, but I would recommend it to others, if only to try to promote a healthier way of eating.   
251940  When I finaly gave this as the gift I purchased it for I had to explain that I bought it online and didn't know what I was getting. It was embarrasing, I was trying to go for something chik to give from one mom to another. Ha ha it would only hold like one diaper and it was a cheap plastic material! Oh well

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price.

282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them.

This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.

392143  I really enjoyed this movie. I never heard of it so it was a pleasant surprise. I don't agree w/ the guy who said it's a lifetime movie. It's an indie film....and if you have seen enough of them you should appreciate this movie.I did like the backwards to foward effect of the movie. However there is a part of the movie that is a little far fetched.Why didn't Page just follow through w/ calling Adult services? The extreme measures she takes to save Jacob did not seem realistic.However, I did like this movie, it kept my attention, and as I said it was Very original. Take the time to rent this one. If you are an Indie fan you should enjoy it.

86065   ""A flock of bleeps"" is as difficult to categorize as Shpongle. it's more dancefloor-oriented, but ranks right up there with ""Tales of the inexpressible"".This beautiful bit of the first song just keeps playing in my head, again and again..""You may have noticed..that I am not all there..myself!""

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them.

184285  I stopped using after once because the smell is sooo strong and pungent.seemed to work ok on first shave interms of increasing the hair grasp and cutthe smell is soo strong (similar to classic old spice but 1000 times stronger) it lasted on shaver even after washing it three times with soap for almost a week                                                                                                        
202605  This is more of a guideline handbook than a novel. It is well written and simple to understand. It teaches a lot about power and politics. Although it was written centuries ago, there are still traces of Machiavelli tactics still being used today.

200316  If you are serious about learning and using Perl, buy the CD. Go search for it on Amazon- ""The Perl CD Bookshelf"". Read my review on the CD.Otherwise, this is a solid book for learning Perl. However, some newbies may find it a little too advanced. I would suggest starting with ""Perl & Cgi: The Visual Quickstart Guide"". It will get you on your feet quickly. Then advance to this book, or the CD, or even both.

240183  I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
166286  Couldn't get enough volume from the base unit to make it usable, even in a quiet office. Handsets were staticy and echoed my voice when talking. Just didn't live up to expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.

65705   If you want fast answer to your water quality this is good for it.If you need more details don't use this. You would have to get the one that you need to send out to the lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
151003  I absolutely love this show. It will definitely be on my DVR schedule.Seems like they had some forced conversations between all the players so that they could move the story along and no one gets lost. But I feel that they could have skipped those and used flashbacks or people's interaction to tell about the relationships of these characters.                                                                                                                                                                               
377611  Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.                                                                                            
1082    I used this book for an entomology class at my college, and I think it is great! Wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already, I still didn't find it boring or tedious, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails.                                                                                                                               
339285  I have an ""ancient"" Canon S750 printer I use for printing my year end financial reports. As I use it only once a year, I would expect the ink cartridges to be fresh if purchased a few months prior to expected use of them Thus far I have not had to use them, but will shortly. The problem with any printer ink cartridge is shelf life. I have learned how to extend the life of some of the older cartidges, but as the printer gets older I may have to resort to purchasing a newer one. I commend the price of this brand.

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
253087  ""Heaven:Close Encounters of the God Kind"", should be called ""I Made It All Up For The Cash"" Jesse Duplantis is another one of these flashy so-called ministers in it only for the $$$. I picked this book up because it sounded interesting, this was before I saw Jesse on TV and heard him repeatedly misquote and change the scripture. I have to say that the book is as big a joke as Jesse and will never read anything else by him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
94384   This book is wonderful! It's about Mia Thermopolis, a 9th grader who lives in NY with her mom. She is your average girl, who dreams of Josh Richter and a bigger bust size. Then she finds out that she is a princess. UH OH! Than the trouble starts! Grandmere (her grandmother)comes to give her princess lessons and turns her world upside down! I know, it sounds like one of those books that are so unbelievable that its stupid; but trust me:you will not want to put this book down!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
233450  Like others have said on here before this is NOT an HP product. It is a cheap knock off.It is better as it has an LED indicator but other than that it was much worse then my HP Original charger. This charger got much hotter then a true HP charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking AC to DC conversion very well.Wish chargers would have the 80 Plus standard that most desktops have but they don't. If they did than 80 Plus certified products wouldn't be as warm and you use less energy! I digress...Bottom line: Has an LED indicator. It chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine HP product. It may not last as long as a real charger but I have not tested that out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
245246  Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product. As I share a house with four other girls, it can be difficult to find a time to practice violin when it won't disturb anyone. I was very excited to find an inexpensively priced mute to dampen the sound. I installed it on the bridge of my instrument and ran the bow across the strings... and it sounded exactly the same. I pushed it on a bit tighter, (as tight as I felt I could put it without damaging my bridge) and it started to muffle the sound slightly, but still wasn't a great deal quieter. It seems to destroy tone quality (which was to be expected; it's a practice tool and not for performing) without making much of a difference in volume (which was the disappointment.) At least it was inexpensive, and I'm only out $5.                                                                                                                                                            
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
321410  I only managed 4 chapters. I write this because I disagree with the other negative reviews about the most fundamental problem with the novel. The chapters I read consisted almost entirely of thumbnail biographical sketches of a bunch of characters, none of whom was interesting. The lack of interest was almost beside the point. A novel should not require this much ""set up"" at the onset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
197083  I've forgotten already what the lead character's name is, but someone who would turn their nose up at $8,000 isn't worth remembering. But, most of the characters are acceptable, except for the case of one woman who was terribly annoying. And yet, when she's taken hostage by a murderer, no one seems to be all that concerned about it, not even her family. They're more interested in finding some money. When next she's seen again, no one bothers to ask her if she's all right or anything. Apparently no one in the book cared all that much about her, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
76437   For my son's 2 year birthday party I ordered this and dipped cupcakes frosted in white frosting in these sprinkles to make it look like asphalt. In the jar the sprinkles look green, but end up looking black once there are enough of them in the frosting. We then put painted lines with icing and set tiny Car's characters one each side of the road. They were a hit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
64268   The item that I brought in the page said that is the correct for my car, I order and when I received the Item don't FIT to my car,the cables was very short to put in the correct side. I return the item and to today's date I don't received the refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4096    It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive, but that does not mean the book is super. I'm sorry, but when I read it, I did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration.The fact is that this is a so-so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so-so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original.The characters are flat, the pacing is horrid, and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little Paolini's hands. No one needs that many adjectives per sentence!Painfully generic and nothing at all special.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
34631   If you are studying the text for a paper or getting it up on it's feet for a play, I highly recommend this publisher. Lines notes and Folio version notes, the only text like it on the market.My only complaint is that it makes it difficult to use in rehearsals and on stage. I use the Penguin for working on my feet because they give you all notes at the end.But for all the prep work needed to really flush out a character, you can't beat this copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
262742  While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
362266  This mouse worked well for me relieving pain in my arm and elbow. However the device did not last 3 months with light use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
22127   I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $25 each. The handle is actually quite good for the price and it's slightly brighter than my similar Heine (F-22.804) handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs don't last. The Heine bulbs last forever. I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
362402  I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
83173   Helllo! I am Mambo Racine Sans Bout, the same Mambo Racine about whom Ross Heaven has so many nice things to say in his book, ""Vodou Shaman"". It is with some regret that I must warn the prospective reader that most of what is in this book never actually happened - Ross is willing to say anything for a buck, apparently. He never let me see what he was writing until the book was published, and I never imagined he would make up so many stories! Now that I have refused to support his activities he is very angry with me, but the fact remains that this book is 99% BUNK.

262681  This book was the required text for my Humanities class this semester; and may I say that it is a waste of money, time and effort. A more superficial text could not have been willfully created; and at $150.00 new/$80.00 used you are better off dropping the class if you can.If you are interested in the culture and history of ancient civilizations read anything but this book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
375245  Im not an expert but is not muy first tank, I bought this one to replace an old one. This is what i found:I choosed the Hex because the design. But if you want to keep fish and develop an aquarium this is not the option for you.Hard to clean the acrilics due to hex designThe opening/lid is very small. It can only be used to feed the fishAcrylic scratches easily, and is impossible to cover up once scratchedThe Filter is crappy, the water was cloudy, tried changing the cartridge and last for 3 weeks with only one fish !!! even doing partial changes of water every week. Had to modify the top to install again my aquaclear filterMy fish don't seem happy in this tank. maybe if you bought guppies and neon tetras or a single Goldfish would work wellTo finish my review after 6 months of being with the hex eclipse Im desperately need a new tank!!                                                                                                
53729   It is what it is. Giving 192 mental tricks, substitutions, insight on habits and offering inspirations. Thing is with any diet, you have to make this something that you'll stick to for the REST OF YOUR LIFE.Otherwise, with ANY diet book, it will work for awhile, and then you go back to your old habits. Question is, HOW BAD DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT OFF?That is for you to decide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
23983   I read Atlas Shrugged after THOROUGHLY enjoying The Fountainhead. I find Ayn Rand's philosophies engaging; however, I was disappointed in this book for several reasons:1. This book clearly needs editing -- themes were repetitious and the book is unnecessarily lengthy2. Characters were one-dimensional -- either good or evil3. Scenarios were somewhat unrealistic -- almost too fantastic to believeIn short, there are some insightful lessons to be learned from Atlas Shrugged. My recommendation is to skip this book and go straight to The Fountainhead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
70681   The average chapter in this ""book"" is measured in paragraphs, not pages. The story could be a great one, but instead of being a story about racism in the Old South, it is a narcissistic ""look-at-poor-me, nobody-had it-worse-than-me"" fantasy tale. My ten-year-old writes more complex sentences, and is less focused on himself than is the writer of this pity party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
369354  Pros: Spout in handle a great ideas and it works well. A compact and fairly well made unit. Very handy under the counter mounting.Cons: Thermal carafe DOES NOT keep coffee hot for more than 15 minutes!!! No light to show that the program timer is set to ""auto"". Very hard to read timer display. I returned mine after two days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
248861  Awesome looking book, but the seller (Amazon.com) sent me a damaged book. I'm pretty disappointed. It had a huge, heavy crease through the entire book. Like several hundred pages of a diagonal, embossed crease. It's as if someone took the entire book, put half of it in an iron clamp, and pulled on the other end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
207000  The dogs in this movie are very cute. No question asked. I thought kids would enjoy the movie yet after watching it for about 20 minutes with 2 kids, both had their attention concentrated somewhere else. Cute dogs dressed as santas are simply not the only ingredients necessary to make a movie work. Let's not offend the kid's intelligence. Santa losing his fake beard, making the movie appear to have more with zen and Buddhism than with Christianity, an evil and scary dog catcher - who can make this kind of stuff up? There are plenty of good movies about Christmas out there. This one just isn't one of them.

Ostensibly struck from 35mm original elements from The National Museum (whoever they are!), what we are given in reality is a scratchy, overly-bright and, most unforgiveably, OUT OF FOCUS, copy of ""Most Dangerous Game""! My public domain Beta copy from 15 years ago looks better than this! The soundtrack is equally poor, filled with loud hiss. ""The Vampire Bat"" fares slightly better; this copy looks no worse than the old pd-videotape copies. At least it's in focus throughout. But this print is NOT complete. My old tape copy runs almost three-minutes longer. My advice is to avoid this disc. ""Game"" is also available on Criterion, so that's the one to buy. This is ""Bat's"" DVD debut, so stick with any of the numerous acceptable tape copies until somebody gets it right on DVD.                                                                             
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
46383   I can't figure out for the life of me why they would make this item with such large top part that fits exterior doors. I couldn't use this in my bathroom because I have standard doors (1 3/8""), which means that these were too big in width at the top and kept wobbling and being very noisy, not to mention scraping the door at the bottom since the side rods weren't vertical, but at an angle towards the door. I even tried putting something to stabilize these (like bubble wrap at the top between the door and the side rails, but that didn't help at all.If they made a version of this with 1 3/8"" doors, I would buy it in an instant and probably be very happy with it. But as it stands, this is useless because I don't need towels hanging on the inside of my front door.                                                                                                                                                                               
381610  I was very excited to see the movie adaptation of this book. The book it was based off of was a great read that depicted one man's testimony of his growing relationship with God. This Dvd was nothing like the book's story. The directors/producers completely changed the storyline and characters. The majority of the movie was not from the book and portrayed a negative view of Christianity with some political influence as well, which was not necessary. I'm very disappointed at this entire portrayal of Donald Miller's book because it was nothing like it. It was only at the very end scene that I caught a glimpse of how the actual book was. I ask that you please read the Blue Like Jazz book before seeing this film.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
1621    The more you know about mountaineering, the funnier you'll find this book. There is little to like, but much to laugh at in Ruth Ann's utterly unselfconscious self-portrait.If this were a comic novel it would be a dead-on parody of a certain strain of self-glorifying mountaineering literature. Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman. And it starts with the twenty-two-word long title!Warning: if you're not in the mood to laugh, be prepared to be annoyed!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
98027   We bought this for my 8 year-old daughter's birthday. She aspires to be a ""prankster"", and had had her eye on this kit for a long time. For the price, I expected something ... better. The fake vomit is about 1.5"" diameter, totally clear. Is it just me, or does anyone else expect the fake vomit to be a healthy brown splat of a thing??? None of the water tricks really work. The dollar bill trick is ridiculous: the string is so short, you really have no hope of being able to hide and trick anybody. The snake-popping-out-of-the-can thing is ANEMIC, that's the only word for it. I know that these are cheesy tricks, and maybe I expected too much -- but then, maybe they shouldn't be charging $[...] for it. Total junk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
45552   I'm not going to go into the plot of FLCL, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation will yet again release another upscaled piece of garbage.The video is grainy, lines are blurry in parts and pixelated in others, partly interlaced, distinctive gradient banding, it windowed (black bars on all sides; caused by 16:10 screens, not present in 16:9 ones) so the video isn't even 1080 by 4x3 standards, etc. See my comments on page 3 for screenshots, as well as the above image section.This honestly is not worth your time or money, especially if you own the DVDs already. You will get the same quality playback on your Blu-ray player with the DVDs as you would this, as most all Blu-ray players upscale DVD anyways. Buy the DVDs or don't buy it at all.This is being return the very next day as it is pure garbage. I really wish Funimation had their licences pulled for making these terrible releases.           
122541  Plays only on sacd players, does not have the 5.1 or 6.1 sound most SACDs have, and if you check around on the internet - the sound is not much better than a regular cd. Funny since 3 (aka Melt), 4 (aka Security) and So sound fine.Great material - but don't bother. Get the individual albums (except the first two which also sound poor in SACD format).I guess that is what you get if you come out with the new technology before most other people - it is imperfect at first. A for effort, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
370196  Have two golden retrievers. Bought this shampooer at the recommendation of the target employee. Within the first year the tank began to leak. I emailed the company and on first reply they said I could buy another one for around 40 dollars. After a less-than-nice email I received one via mail. Less than a year after that the brushes stopped spinning, conveniently after the warranty ran out. Do not buy this machine. My parents have a dirt devil and although it does not clean as well on the first go, it has lasted longer than 18 months (about 5 years) reliably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
149248  Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
156496  The new version of the diaper genie is a dramatic step backwards. Having had both, I wish I could find the older one either here on Amazon or in a store. The new one jams and shreds the plastic film 3-4 times a week, needing careful work with scissors to salvage it. It cannot be emptied the normal way, again requiring scissors. I wouldn't buy this thing again if you begged me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
170898  I have used this program for about a year and now I am stuck. I would like to change programs because of the limiting features but I can not. The program does not export clients, print lables or have useful search capablities. You would be better off to look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
30245   If you want a phone that looks good, then this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good phone, this is not the one. The phone locks up every now and then. When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
128235  this is a super little book, really gives food for thought and makes you aware of the futility of wanting to control everything. there are a few bits in there that are slightly irritating, but overall has the potential to be a life changing book!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
109232  Program runs fine the first few times and then the problems begin. My files wouldn't render completely, discs would not burn, and program just locked up frequently. I am running this with PLENTY of speed and memory, so I tried re-installing the program several times with a further decline in performance. Another problem was the update from the website. When I downloaded this, my menus and title features were scattered all over my videos. After failed burning and wasting several DVD and CD's, I am no longer using this software. Save yourself the headache from the beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
211425  Oh my god. I expected so much more from a food with 4.5 stars.This tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria. Like canned food.I couldn't even eat half a bowl, let alone a whole box!

110250  With a mix of the story line and action you feel as if this was one of your wacky nightmares that you had last week and had to tell everyone about. The first scene is like a drug .... your hooked staight away and feel like part of the family ! you have the urge to find out what will happen and then things just go WRONG !! you say to yourself '' no ! how could that happen ! this guy has been through enough , can't he get his life back !!!! '' But then he starts to take the role of the person he looks like and lives his life . But then on the other hand , so is Mr bad guy !! This is a must for any one who enjoys action and a little science fiction !! You'll feel like you want to help the poor guy !!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
326735  Some of the instructions are not very clear. Such as, what time frame can you take the dose, especially if you miss the dose at the time you eat your meal (up to 30 mins. before or 30 mins. after, 1 hr. before, 1 hr. after, etc.). It is not clear on the product or the information that is sent or on the website. When Alli first came out, I went through a screen test on the internet and according to my answers I gave, I was a candidate. However, now, it appears, due to my diet and the amount of weight I need to lose(less than 20lbs), Alli is better left to those who need to lose at least 35lbs or more. I am sticking with it because I think it helps me stay on track with my diet, and I have seen results. However, I cannot say that all of my results are due to Alli.                                                                                                                                                                            
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
277392  Camera did not take good pictures indoor or outdoor, a bit blury (set to Auto of course)and yes my hand was still.Delay lag is a bit long although Nikon claims that its quick (still takes long to autofocus and then snap the shot)Bit the bullet and spent twice as much on Canon G6 and MUCH BETTER, you get what you pay for. Couple hundred more at 900 you can get Rebel G but its quite big and plastic. Liked the feel of the G6, metal, and takes great pics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
312220  I played their first three albums to death. I was disappointed by this album. The lyrics were as biting as Bob's lyrics always are, but music was not up to the level of the first three albums. The song Steve wrote was the best one on the album.I left my copy of the CD in my desk when I quit the job I was working because I knew I wasn't going to listen to it again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
365966  This watch may be comfy and stylish, but unfortunately it will become a dead piece of jewelry (bracelet) when it dies, which it will. The date doesn't reset at the end of the month, you'll have to do this EVERY MONTH and the mechanism will wear out prematurely probably as a result. Even ignoring the date function, when my watch stopped just out of warranty, the cost of repair was greater than new. Movado refuses even the basic courtesies and won't acknowledge the design flaw.There are other choices with decent warrantees.

162924  Don't purchase this item. It's plastic with an outside coating of metal. Very cheap and not worth the cost. I purchased another product through a repeatable retailer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.

53277   Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!                                                                                                                                     
2521    This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies.

25580   Whow, slow down there, Carl! Are you sure you're accompanying the right band? The strength of the former Fields of the Nephilim lay in their slow, moody, atmospherically dense songs that rose, developed, climaxed, and finally melded seamlessly into the next track. If that is what you liked, you will be terribly disappointed by Zoon. This has got almost nothing to do with their previous work; it is as clean a cut as I have ever heard. While there may be musical merit here that speed- and heavy metal fans could appreciate, this combination of guitar-torturing and 300-bpm-drum-flogging is bound to make the ears of any Fields fan hurt. In needing to keep up with the music, Carl McCoy's voice is sadly reduced to a harsh, low belching sound, typical for other bands of this genre. The one exception is the incredibly beautiful and melodious ""Shine"", which is worth five stars when viewed by itself. If you're a former Fields fan, be sure to listen to this before you buy it.   
365500  ...in silliness!Mr. Goodner probably has some good points to make -- I doubt anything Oprah pushes is really good -- but to spend, what, five pages going on about Plato's Cave allegory is pedantic in the extreme: we get the point, let's move on....Now, I said that the author ""probably"" has some good points in his book because I haven't read it -- just browsing the few scanned pages turned me off (the two-star rating reflects those few pages scanned in). I'm no codependency cult fan; I just wanted to hear this side of the matter, but the style of writing was so pedantic and smug as to have made me think that reading this would be a real bore, too!Hopefully the tone of the writing will be amended -- and the pedanticism excised -- in a future edition. Again, there are probably good points here against codependent psycho-babble (I myself don't know enough either way right now)...just wish they were made more intelligently and, even, more humanely.                        
340204  when you are on the verge of either crying or screaming, but you are not sure which one, and you cannot express with words how upset you are...this album will be the sweetest thing you have ever heard, and you will almost want to keep your broken heart simply because the beauty of this album turns the suffering into beautythe passion alone makes this album worth buyingbut to top it off, they express their passion perfectly with a new, breathtaking album that has stong infulences in hardcore punk and a unique guitar style that is a pleasure to listen tothis album thrives with its ability to elicit strong sentimental value, and almost impossible feat that every musician wished they could accomplishit is similar to being really thirsty and drinking a nice cold glass of waterit is also very energetic and your sorrows seem to drownd out in the sea of musical intensity Fear Before the March of Flames have created in this albumit is awesome                                  
136637  I've been waiting nearly 4 years for this film and it did not disappoint. Exactly what I expected. A satirical B-Movie with Great Special Effects and a fantastic score by Laibach. I recommend it to anyone that doesn't take their entertainment tastes too seriously and are open to B-Grade films. Fun!

The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
166286  Couldn't get enough volume from the base unit to make it usable, even in a quiet office. Handsets were staticy and echoed my voice when talking. Just didn't live up to expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.

211425  Oh my god. I expected so much more from a food with 4.5 stars.This tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria.

12461   Twilight the gayest thing in this world. I'm so tired of these stupid movies.

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
359898  These two golden age horror films are done a gross disservice by E-Biz's DVD pressing. Ostensibly struck from 35mm original elements from The National Museum (whoever they are!), what we are given in reality is a scratchy, overly-bright and, most unforgiveably, OUT OF FOCUS, copy of ""Most Dangerous Game""! My public domain Beta copy from 15 years ago looks better than this! The soundtrack is equally poor, filled with loud hiss. ""The Vampire Bat"" fares slightly better; this copy looks no worse than the old pd-videotape copies. At least it's in focus throughout. But this print is NOT complete. My old tape copy runs almost three-minutes longer. My advice is to avoid this disc. ""Game"" is also available on Criterion, so that's the one to buy. This is ""Bat's"" DVD debut, so stick with any of the numerous acceptable tape copies until somebody gets it right on DVD.

When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
293143  Of course, one of the main characters is a dog -- and so is this book. I really enjoy Martha Grimes' early works but this one is a huge disappointment. It's very sad -- I hope she's not written out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
362402  I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!                                                                                                                                                                                                  
109232  Program runs fine the first few times and then the problems begin. My files wouldn't render completely, discs would not burn, and program just locked up frequently. I am running this with PLENTY of speed and memory, so I tried re-installing the program several times with a further decline in performance. Another problem was the update from the website. When I downloaded this, my menus and title features were scattered all over my videos. After failed burning and wasting several DVD and CD's, I am no longer using this software. Save yourself the headache from the beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
243434  I was disappointed with this dvd.To me it was too much Jerry Lee Lewis and not enough of the other singers.(I am not knocking Jerry Lee,I enjoy his country hits).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
369354  Pros: Spout in handle a great ideas and it works well. A compact and fairly well made unit. Very handy under the counter mounting.Cons: Thermal carafe DOES NOT keep coffee hot for more than 15 minutes!!! No light to show that the program timer is set to ""auto"". Very hard to read timer display. I returned mine after two days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
98027   We bought this for my 8 year-old daughter's birthday. She aspires to be a ""prankster"", and had had her eye on this kit for a long time. For the price, I expected something ... better. The fake vomit is about 1.5"" diameter, totally clear. Is it just me, or does anyone else expect the fake vomit to be a healthy brown splat of a thing??? None of the water tricks really work. The dollar bill trick is ridiculous: the string is so short, you really have no hope of being able to hide and trick anybody. The snake-popping-out-of-the-can thing is ANEMIC, that's the only word for it. I know that these are cheesy tricks, and maybe I expected too much -- but then, maybe they shouldn't be charging $[...] for it. Total junk.                                                                                                                                                       
100687  My 1G Attache worked fine for a couple of months of very light use and then suddenly Windows reported that it was ""write-protected"". I can not find any way to unprotect it and I can not find any way to contact PNY technical support. I will have to try the method described above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
176647  2 stars is for the  of songs I can actually stand on this CD. I loved the 2 previous albums, but this one is whiney and concentrates mainly on the lead singer's voice, which isn't all that great. This album falls short of Coldplay's earlier work by an infinite amount. Too bad. I don't recommend it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.

65705   If you want fast answer to your water quality this is good for it.If you need more details don't use this. You would have to get the one that you need to send out to the lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
151003  I absolutely love this show. It will definitely be on my DVR schedule.Seems like they had some forced conversations between all the players so that they could move the story along and no one gets lost. But I feel that they could have skipped those and used flashbacks or people's interaction to tell about the relationships of these characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
377611  Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
1082    I used this book for an entomology class at my college, and I think it is great! Wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already, I still didn't find it boring or tedious, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
339285  I have an ""ancient"" Canon S750 printer I use for printing my year end financial reports. As I use it only once a year, I would expect the ink cartridges to be fresh if purchased a few months prior to expected use of them Thus far I have not had to use them, but will shortly. The problem with any printer ink cartridge is shelf life. I have learned how to extend the life of some of the older cartidges, but as the printer gets older I may have to resort to purchasing a newer one. I commend the price of this brand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
12014   This book had me laughing at nearly every page. The situations Halliday gets into on her very-low-budget travels are mostly of the distressing variety: illness, theft, and missed cultural opportunities fill the chapters. Halliday has a wonderful gift, however, for pointing out the humor in all of these situations. She also describes unusual experiences which most travel books would never cover, and that is exactly what makes this book different from most travel books: you won't learn about all the museums and palaces in each country she has visited. Instead, you'll learn why you might *not* want to buy cigarettes from an 8-year-old on the streets of Vietnam, why there is no such thing as a free backrub, and why you should bolt your doors when staying in Pushkar, India. Overall, I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it to anyone except, possibly, those who would be easily offended by a couple of chapters that discuss drug use.   
179538  I purchased two of these 3-wheel bikes for maintenance personnel at a large apartment property. They love them, the basket is large and they can now carry tools and suppies from one location to another easily and faster. They also look great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
325039  I'm hacked at Home Depot that they would sell a one-of-a-kind product (Black & Decker Firestorm 15.6v product) created specifically for Home Depot and then discontinue support. Now, replacement batteries are diffcult to find - thankfully, not impossible.This battery works perfectly - hopefully, it will last a long, long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
381929  This watch stands out in price/performance terms in this category. I replaced a 5-year old similar Casio model that was all plastic and required a battery. (When you are deep in the mountains batteries are a nuisance.)With solar power the watch is always ready for action. It even conserves power when it sits overnight by turning off the display. All the functions work as documented.One minor feature that is surprisingly useful to me is the time zone change function based on city location. It's much faster and easier to switch as you move around the world.With a titanium band I expect this one to last at least 5 years. Although the watch is large and noticeable it is very lightweight.Expect to get labeled as a bit of a geek if you wear this watch as a day to day timepiece. It's information over style although the looks work for me.                                                                                                                
175766  It's a really innovative product, makes awesome coffee and is so low tech you could take it camping. Really brilliant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
367903  I am NOT a tea person. My wife however drinks tea all the time and converted me to THIS drink since I became a diabetic. It does not have the after-taste you find in many of the cheaper store brands. I don't even feel it is necessary to add sugar or lemon to ""mask"" the taste as with other products. It is an easy tea to prepare (just using our tea maker) and is usually consumed in two days (thus avoiding the taste that accompanies any tea that sits too long.)Highly recommended!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
143171  Heavy Duty Safe & Durable Pressure Cooker. I highly recommend this pressure cooker for canning. Its awesome! The canner won't dent and the clamp down lid makes it safer than lower cost versions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
210745  These 2 movies are some of my favorite of all time. The 5th element, I have probably watched over 100 times since it came out. I can never get enough of it. I first saw Gattaca in my high school science class, and ever since I have always loved it. If you have never seen these movies, give them a chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
81724   I always considered the EVANS-DAVIS collaboration an intellectual one and the COLTRANE-DAVIS collaboration an intuitive one.So naturally,apart from SKETCHES OF SPAIN i do not rave over their mutual recordings.What's the point of making a PORGY AND BESS record without the singing or the continuity?Where is I GOT PLENTY OF NOTHIN and why GONE ,an original not even composed by the GERSHWINS?For me,this is a rather unpleasant affair.I enjoyed it more from track 9 on.If you want to hear PORGY AND BESS ,but do not want to hear the complete work,try ELLA and LOUIS who gave us a near perfect sampler.I won't win new friends with my review,but as the man says,you've got to say what you think.I must admit that upon reading the other reviewers,i feel lonely.                                                                                                                                                                                                      
125008  It's funny reading through all these reviews that no one has noticed how much they sound like Maroon 5! In fact, I'd go as far to say that this is a Maroon 5 sound-alike band (even the lead singer's voice).Now don't get me wrong, I love Maroon 5... and I really like this CD. But, you gotta call a spade a spade, and this CD is in no way paving an original path. However, the first few songs on this CD are excellent, and rival anything Maroon 5 has done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
371360  Of the several types of bibs for my children, ages 6 months through 4 years, the Bumkins brand bibs do the best job of protecting clothes and catching spilled food and drink. The neck strap is velcro and is conveniently located on the side, so you can tighten it as needed. It does a good job for those first-feedings --- when the baby food drips down your baby's neck. I've never had a problem with food or drink spilling underneath of it. The bib is long enough to protect shirts and catch most spills. Because it is made of flexible material, it can fit in between your child and the high chair table.My complaints: yes, they are machine-washable. But if you wash them in the machine, the plastic material will begin to break down and flake off. I hand wash them. Be sure to thoroughly dry them also. If left wet, they put off an awful stench.                                                                                                            
34631   If you are studying the text for a paper or getting it up on it's feet for a play, I highly recommend this publisher. Lines notes and Folio version notes, the only text like it on the market.My only complaint is that it makes it difficult to use in rehearsals and on stage. I use the Penguin for working on my feet because they give you all notes at the end.But for all the prep work needed to really flush out a character, you can't beat this copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
250496  This version took a big risk and, eventhough its tough to see, it was a woderful film. True, Brandy doesn't have the best voice for R&H but her Cinderella was a stronger character and more believable, instead of the usual weak Cinderella. Having great B'dway stars like Bernadette Peters, Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg, Victor Garber, Paolo Montalban and the two step sister brought life, woderful acting, and wonderful singing to the film. Even though Whitney Houston wasn't the best choice for the Fairy Godmother she produced the movie and you have to admit she can sing. The sets, costumes, and special effects were amazing and brought out the story book mood, something the other versions never did and R&H's score was beautifully brought back to its full glory that just wasn't in the 1965 production. Though the film has a few flaws it's a great film!!                                                                                            
285387  This is the first Lincoln Rhyme story I've read and I wasn't a bit confused about his ""history"". A well-written page-turner, it was hard to put down. Liked everything about it except the use of the ""empty chair"" technique. That seemed a little out of place, would have liked it better if more time was spent on it to make it a little more suspensefull.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
368691  I have been taking this for a few weeks now with no side effects. Not sure how much or if it is actually helping but it's sure worth a try and its natural.

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

240183  I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
166286  Couldn't get enough volume from the base unit to make it usable, even in a quiet office. Handsets were staticy and echoed my voice when talking. Just didn't live up to expectations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.   
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!

65705   If you want fast answer to your water quality this is good for it.If you need more details don't use this. You would have to get the one that you need to send out to the lab.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
151003  I absolutely love this show. It will definitely be on my DVR schedule.Seems like they had some forced conversations between all the players so that they could move the story along and no one gets lost. But I feel that they could have skipped those and used flashbacks or people's interaction to tell about the relationships of these characters.                                                                                                                                                                               
377611  Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.                                                                                            
1082    I used this book for an entomology class at my college, and I think it is great! Wanting to be an entomologist and knowing a lot of information about the subject already, I still didn't find it boring or tedious, and people who know nothing about insects can understand it pretty easily too. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in entomology and what the subject entails.                                                                                                                               
339285  I have an ""ancient"" Canon S750 printer I use for printing my year end financial reports. As I use it only once a year, I would expect the ink cartridges to be fresh if purchased a few months prior to expected use of them Thus far I have not had to use them, but will shortly. The problem with any printer ink cartridge is shelf life. I have learned how to extend the life of some of the older cartidges, but as the printer gets older I may have to resort to purchasing a newer one. I commend the price of this brand.

17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
362402  I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
149248  Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
381208  Got it this week an have used it for a few days, by the second day it had fallen apart and today it does not work. Wouldn't recommended this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
45552   I'm not going to go into the plot of FLCL, other sites and reviewers have that covered, but here is the deal, Funimation will yet again release another upscaled piece of garbage.The video is grainy, lines are blurry in parts and pixelated in others, partly interlaced, distinctive gradient banding, it windowed (black bars on all sides; caused by 16:10 screens, not present in 16:9 ones) so the video isn't even 1080 by 4x3 standards, etc. See my comments on page 3 for screenshots, as well as the above image section.This honestly is not worth your time or money, especially if you own the DVDs already. You will get the same quality playback on your Blu-ray player with the DVDs as you would this, as most all Blu-ray players upscale DVD anyways. Buy the DVDs or don't buy it at all.This is being return the very next day as it is pure garbage. I really wish Funimation had their licences pulled for making these terrible releases.                                                 
253087  ""Heaven:Close Encounters of the God Kind"", should be called ""I Made It All Up For The Cash"" Jesse Duplantis is another one of these flashy so-called ministers in it only for the $$$. I picked this book up because it sounded interesting, this was before I saw Jesse on TV and heard him repeatedly misquote and change the scripture. I have to say that the book is as big a joke as Jesse and will never read anything else by him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
161949  As a traditional coffee mug It Is fine,but for travel It Is terrible. You have to be careful when you fill It that the liquid Is not too high In the mug. The top protrudes Into the mug so when you ""lock"" It In, It makes the liquid overflow. Tossed the lid and use It as a regular coffee mug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
64268   The item that I brought in the page said that is the correct for my car, I order and when I received the Item don't FIT to my car,the cables was very short to put in the correct side. I return the item and to today's date I don't received the refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
258243  The recent trend of herocide, or the slaying of mythical heros of history, seems to me rather trite. The historians that barge onto the scene, denouncing grade school heros as tyrants, scoundrels or infidels are no better than the lauditory historians that heap praise on national figures. The answer here is not to find some ultimate condemnation or deification of historical figures, but to understand them within the context of their time and understand their actions and motives. I blame much of the poor response to biographies on this. Without this effort to explain actions, the point of biographies is to me, entirely unclear. Unless we understand historical figures, how can we possibly condemn or laud them. It behooves us much to neglect those writings that seek a good/bad dichotomy, and instead focus our attention on writings that face the humanity of historical figures. Mr. Dilorenzo would do well to drop his agenda and try and explain Lincoln, not demonize him.   
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.

372211  Love this ring, I wear it all the time. This was my first time ordering a ring online and must say it was a great first time! If you like turtles, this is the ring for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
325039  I'm hacked at Home Depot that they would sell a one-of-a-kind product (Black & Decker Firestorm 15.6v product) created specifically for Home Depot and then discontinue support. Now, replacement batteries are diffcult to find - thankfully, not impossible.This battery works perfectly - hopefully, it will last a long, long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
116905  this book give you some great ideas. it will lead you to the right path on your journey to good healthy hair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
368691  I have been taking this for a few weeks now with no side effects. Not sure how much or if it is actually helping but it's sure worth a try and its natural.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
155860  I was lucky enough to have Pandora choke up one of his songs for me and introduce me to Dustin. I loose my breath on ""Opus 22"" and can listen to this album for hours while sketching away. Pure beauty.....(sigh).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
81724   I always considered the EVANS-DAVIS collaboration an intellectual one and the COLTRANE-DAVIS collaboration an intuitive one.So naturally,apart from SKETCHES OF SPAIN i do not rave over their mutual recordings.What's the point of making a PORGY AND BESS record without the singing or the continuity?Where is I GOT PLENTY OF NOTHIN and why GONE ,an original not even composed by the GERSHWINS?For me,this is a rather unpleasant affair.I enjoyed it more from track 9 on.If you want to hear PORGY AND BESS ,but do not want to hear the complete work,try ELLA and LOUIS who gave us a near perfect sampler.I won't win new friends with my review,but as the man says,you've got to say what you think.I must admit that upon reading the other reviewers,i feel lonely.   
151003  I absolutely love this show. It will definitely be on my DVR schedule.Seems like they had some forced conversations between all the players so that they could move the story along and no one gets lost. But I feel that they could have skipped those and used flashbacks or people's interaction to tell about the relationships of these characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
287996  If you like cookingthis is a cook book.Lays flat and stay sput, just there on the table.Never needs rechargeing like thse awlful iCrappy things.There are no distracting games to makeit crash and burn. and best of all it is easy to read in bright light.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
206781  Product was as advertised and arrived on time. The groves in the mat are pretty deep, and therefore a little more difficult to clean out, but they do trap dirt and water which is what a floor mat should do,

168883  I love to read, and enjoy an easy summer read as much as the next person, but I can't recommend anyone buy this book. It's an ok book to borrow. I read this very quickly, had a hard time putting it down, but the plot was very thin. I also HATED the fact that each chapter was only 1-3 pages long!! Seems like an easy was to make the book look much longer than it really is and therefore justify the high price. Spend your hard earned money on a better book.                                                 
282374  Very poor qualityThe dolly for under the track bent the 1st time I used itMetal is way to thin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
385534  obviously David Gilmour is missing, but Snowy and the others do quite well. All I really need to say here is ...Roger Waters...Buy It!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
189914  O.k. this is just a waste of money... If you wan't to see Britney Spears I'd advise you to get Britney Spears Live and More, or Time Out with Britney Spears... This video has absolutely no Britney Spears in it at all, and no music videos and just plain nada... Unless, you are a collector on Britney Spears items that would be the only logical reason of getting this video... I don't like reading books and I found Britney Spears Heart to Heart book more interesting than this! I give it two thumbs down   
387201  I am glad I only got their best of their song. I was going to purchse all of their CDs. For some reason I stoped and got only one of them. It was not my kind of music . :(

233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
319222  I'm quite disappointed with this video: the routine itself is okay (though nothing outstanding), BUT the instructor P.J.O'Clair (who is not the one on the cover b.t.w.) talks throughout the WHOLE video with about TWICE the speed you'd normally speak with - this was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the actual yoga at all. I mean, who can do yoga if someone talks to them ALL THE TIME?!I just can not.There is an option on the DVD to just listen to the music, but that didn't make sense for me either as I missed the transitions into the next pose when I wasn't looking at the screen (like in down dog). Additionally the music was enervating as well because it consists of a short piano sequence that is repeated from the beginning to the end of the routine :-(...(and everytime you put the DVD into the player you have to watch the introductory advertisement again!)conclusion: unusable for me & my first and last video from Stott     
167064  I don't know what is going on with this packaging tape, but it isn't sticky! I have gone through two rolls wrapping just a few packages because the tape doesn't stick to anything except itself. I don't know what the problem here is, but definitely DO NOT buy this product. I thought it was a fluke, but this is the second time this has happened to me ordering this product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
253087  ""Heaven:Close Encounters of the God Kind"", should be called ""I Made It All Up For The Cash"" Jesse Duplantis is another one of these flashy so-called ministers in it only for the $$$. I picked this book up because it sounded interesting, this was before I saw Jesse on TV and heard him repeatedly misquote and change the scripture. I have to say that the book is as big a joke as Jesse and will never read anything else by him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
293143  Of course, one of the main characters is a dog -- and so is this book. I really enjoy Martha Grimes' early works but this one is a huge disappointment. It's very sad -- I hope she's not written out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
33745   It is not what I expected... I am very disappointed with it!I was expecting more drawing and clear pictures...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
233450  Like others have said on here before this is NOT an HP product. It is a cheap knock off.It is better as it has an LED indicator but other than that it was much worse then my HP Original charger. This charger got much hotter then a true HP charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking AC to DC conversion very well.Wish chargers would have the 80 Plus standard that most desktops have but they don't. If they did than 80 Plus certified products wouldn't be as warm and you use less energy! I digress...Bottom line: Has an LED indicator. It chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine HP product. It may not last as long as a real charger but I have not tested that out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
245246  Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product. As I share a house with four other girls, it can be difficult to find a time to practice violin when it won't disturb anyone. I was very excited to find an inexpensively priced mute to dampen the sound. I installed it on the bridge of my instrument and ran the bow across the strings... and it sounded exactly the same. I pushed it on a bit tighter, (as tight as I felt I could put it without damaging my bridge) and it started to muffle the sound slightly, but still wasn't a great deal quieter. It seems to destroy tone quality (which was to be expected; it's a practice tool and not for performing) without making much of a difference in volume (which was the disappointment.) At least it was inexpensive, and I'm only out $5.                                                                                                                                                            
12461   Twilight the gayest thing in this world. I'm so tired of these stupid movies. Can't wait for them to end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
321410  I only managed 4 chapters. I write this because I disagree with the other negative reviews about the most fundamental problem with the novel. The chapters I read consisted almost entirely of thumbnail biographical sketches of a bunch of characters, none of whom was interesting. The lack of interest was almost beside the point. A novel should not require this much ""set up"" at the onset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
374050  Just want to add to the list of failed clips. I had one of these cases as did one of my friends. Both broke at the swivel in less than a month. Nice case but defective design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
243434  I was disappointed with this dvd.To me it was too much Jerry Lee Lewis and not enough of the other singers.(I am not knocking Jerry Lee,I enjoy his country hits).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
197083  I've forgotten already what the lead character's name is, but someone who would turn their nose up at $8,000 isn't worth remembering. But, most of the characters are acceptable, except for the case of one woman who was terribly annoying. And yet, when she's taken hostage by a murderer, no one seems to be all that concerned about it, not even her family. They're more interested in finding some money. When next she's seen again, no one bothers to ask her if she's all right or anything. Apparently no one in the book cared all that much about her, either.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
140663  does'nt work very well; put some pieces outside, really hard to use; I need another and I don't recommand this product at all; it's not normal to sell those kind of bad products!!!!!!!!!!

64268   The item that I brought in the page said that is the correct for my car, I order and when I received the Item don't FIT to my car,the cables was very short to put in the correct side. I return the item and to today's date I don't received the refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4096    It's sad that so much of the hullabaloo over this book comes from the fact that the author was a teenager when he wrote it. That's all well and good and impressive, but that does not mean the book is super. I'm sorry, but when I read it, I did not think about how old the author was and take that into consideration.The fact is that this is a so-so fantasy that follows the lines of so many other so-so fantasies without doing anything the least bit original.The characters are flat, the pacing is horrid, and someone needed to rip the thesaurus from little Paolini's hands. No one needs that many adjectives per sentence!Painfully generic and nothing at all special.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
387872  My wife and I loved Mr. B's last album (is it really that long ago?) ""Out of the Cradle"". It was raw, inventive, with impressive musicianship and great singing. ""Under the Skin"" is almost none of these things (other than the singing.) The writing is boring, the songs, uninventive and repetitious, the musicianship acceptable, if you like not much more than fast rhythm guitar strumming. Altogether, we were shocked and disappointed. We waited more than a decade for this? As my wife suggested, this is what happens when a songwriter gets happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
180194  Calling this man a chef is like calling a camp councilor a psychiatrist. Poor Ed can barely string a sentence together, so how we might learn a thing by listening to him ""talk"" remains this film's greatest mystery. Watching people pay to knead dough while he cracks the lamest jokes on the planet? The best part of this DVD was knowing I could turn it off and walk away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
362063  Sappy and soporific, this attempt at seriocomic film noir is like a nightmare that rambles senselessly hither and yon, engulfing the viewer in a morass of near surreality of silliness! One could well imagine Abbott and Costello showing up at any moment!Why Deanna Durbin's comedic and musical talents were plastered onto such a plot is a mystery, especially since the story spasmodically struggles to rise above the manic stooginess of it all. Some of the actors actually manage to perform unscathed by the flakiness--particulary Dan Duryea, who serves as a painful reminder of what the film could have been. Most, however, are utterly wasted--including a white cat lugged listlessly about by one villain. One waits eagerly for the mere prop of a puss to spring from its human's arms and guide the plot to a providential turn. But, alas!                                                                                                           
223419  I was given this book by someone who believes all people have aura around them which only believers can see. This is the kind of book she obviously loved. A psychologically insecure but obviously rich guy sees a psychotic lady and flies to a Latin American country where people are authoritarian, rude, and against ""scientific"" progress. (The book is a disguised insult to Latams.) There he joins a bunch of other psychotic pseudo-scientists who eat hallucinogenics and see things. A silly story, were it not for the possibility that young people reading it might end up believing this b*l*s*it and setting foot on the way to craziness. After reading up to the third chapter I found a ""spiritualist"" psychologist who obviously believes that stuff, had already read the book, and was eager to read it a second time, so I gave it to her. There is a market for anything.                                                                             
262742  While the CD has a variety of titles, the sound quality is very poor. Some songs sound like they were recorded in a tin can. Others are muddy. Do not waste your money on this CD, or any of the Hit Parades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
362266  This mouse worked well for me relieving pain in my arm and elbow. However the device did not last 3 months with light use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
22127   I bought four of these handles and with minimal use two bulbs blew out and they cost $25 each. The handle is actually quite good for the price and it's slightly brighter than my similar Heine (F-22.804) handles but I could never recommend this Welch Allyn handle because the bulbs don't last. The Heine bulbs last forever. I called Welch Allyn to discuss this and got no response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
242298  Anne Rice sure has gotten wordy over the last 10 years. She's much too in love with the sound of her own narration to merit as much adoration and attention as she gets

243608  I was very disappointed on when I received my dvds in the mail both dvd cases were bursted up very badly. the box was all bent up to pieces as well. The DVDs were fine and play good, but I'm disappointed on how they were shipped. I don't want my money back on the dvds all I want is to make sure you do a better job on shipping your items in next time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
83173   Helllo! I am Mambo Racine Sans Bout, the same Mambo Racine about whom Ross Heaven has so many nice things to say in his book, ""Vodou Shaman"". It is with some regret that I must warn the prospective reader that most of what is in this book never actually happened - Ross is willing to say anything for a buck, apparently. He never let me see what he was writing until the book was published, and I never imagined he would make up so many stories! Now that I have refused to support his activities he is very angry with me, but the fact remains that this book is 99% BUNK.

333411  I bought this DVD on sale in K-Mart. After watching it for a first time I thru it straight to the garbage. The quality of the DVD was good, but the movie was really bad. It looks like they invested a lot of money to produce this movie. But it does not worth watching even one time. All jokes are silly, and the plot is stupid. The only funny moment was a scene with nuns after they gave away the problem child. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. It does not worth a dime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
29560   After second time going to the beach U-Lock stopped working, with luck managed to unlock after almost half an hour struggle, it useless now. Do not buy it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
355193  This lamp lasted no time. The bottom of the lamp detached from the base within a few months of not even moving the lamp-and bulbs burn out quickly and are expensive for this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
122541  Plays only on sacd players, does not have the 5.1 or 6.1 sound most SACDs have, and if you check around on the internet - the sound is not much better than a regular cd. Funny since 3 (aka Melt), 4 (aka Security) and So sound fine.Great material - but don't bother. Get the individual albums (except the first two which also sound poor in SACD format).I guess that is what you get if you come out with the new technology before most other people - it is imperfect at first. A for effort, though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
370196  Have two golden retrievers. Bought this shampooer at the recommendation of the target employee. Within the first year the tank began to leak. I emailed the company and on first reply they said I could buy another one for around 40 dollars. After a less-than-nice email I received one via mail. Less than a year after that the brushes stopped spinning, conveniently after the warranty ran out. Do not buy this machine. My parents have a dirt devil and although it does not clean as well on the first go, it has lasted longer than 18 months (about 5 years) reliably.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
149248  Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
156496  The new version of the diaper genie is a dramatic step backwards. Having had both, I wish I could find the older one either here on Amazon or in a store. The new one jams and shreds the plastic film 3-4 times a week, needing careful work with scissors to salvage it. It cannot be emptied the normal way, again requiring scissors. I wouldn't buy this thing again if you begged me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
170898  I have used this program for about a year and now I am stuck. I would like to change programs because of the limiting features but I can not. The program does not export clients, print lables or have useful search capablities. You would be better off to look elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
197391  It was rather predictable and there was no coherant plot line, just a way to move from sex scene to sex scene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
30245   If you want a phone that looks good, then this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good phone, this is not the one. The phone locks up every now and then. When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
138169  I have to admit I did finish this book. Luckily it didn't take long. The main character, Carolyn Sullivan, continues to do incredibly stupid things. The plot doesn't hang together. The conclusion is down right unsatisfying and the dialogue is laughable. Don't even bother taking it out of the library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
109232  Program runs fine the first few times and then the problems begin. My files wouldn't render completely, discs would not burn, and program just locked up frequently. I am running this with PLENTY of speed and memory, so I tried re-installing the program several times with a further decline in performance. Another problem was the update from the website. When I downloaded this, my menus and title features were scattered all over my videos. After failed burning and wasting several DVD and CD's, I am no longer using this software. Save yourself the headache from the beginning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
250260  I bought this book to prepare my 3-year-old for preschool. While the pictures are cute and colorful, it is not written for her age (maybe for a one-yr-old). Not much content at all to explain to her what school is all about. I think we read it once or twice, and she hasn't asked to look at it again. Go with ""DW's Guide to Preschool"" instead - you won't be disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
238328  I agreed with 'a reader from Richmond.' This book stunk! I found Lute to be a totally obnoxious man with very few redeeming qualities. After enjoying books by Garlock such as The Listening Sky (my favorite), The Edge of Town, and With Hope, I was totally disappointed with the plot, the characters, and the overall plot of this book. If you've never read a Dorothy Garlock book, don't start with this one. Read one of the ones I mentioned and you'll be a Garlock fan. If you read this book first, you'll probably never read another one of her books and you'll miss out on some wonderful historical romances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
211425  Oh my god. I expected so much more from a food with 4.5 stars.This tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria. Like canned food.I couldn't even eat half a bowl, let alone a whole box!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
273906  WATCH DOES NOT MATCHING BOOK ALSO INSTRUCTIONS NOT VERY UNSTANDABLE. NOT TOO HAPPY WHEN IT ARRIVED AND DIFFERENT ON MAIN PAGE FOR AMAZON OR RETAILLER                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
326735  Some of the instructions are not very clear. Such as, what time frame can you take the dose, especially if you miss the dose at the time you eat your meal (up to 30 mins. before or 30 mins. after, 1 hr. before, 1 hr. after, etc.). It is not clear on the product or the information that is sent or on the website. When Alli first came out, I went through a screen test on the internet and according to my answers I gave, I was a candidate. However, now, it appears, due to my diet and the amount of weight I need to lose(less than 20lbs), Alli is better left to those who need to lose at least 35lbs or more. I am sticking with it because I think it helps me stay on track with my diet, and I have seen results. However, I cannot say that all of my results are due to Alli.                                                                                                                                                                            
327141  the lyrics are so simpel and the music is simpel! i don't like this at all. the new album is better!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
277392  Camera did not take good pictures indoor or outdoor, a bit blury (set to Auto of course)and yes my hand was still.Delay lag is a bit long although Nikon claims that its quick (still takes long to autofocus and then snap the shot)Bit the bullet and spent twice as much on Canon G6 and MUCH BETTER, you get what you pay for. Couple hundred more at 900 you can get Rebel G but its quite big and plastic. Liked the feel of the G6, metal, and takes great pics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
312220  I played their first three albums to death. I was disappointed by this album. The lyrics were as biting as Bob's lyrics always are, but music was not up to the level of the first three albums. The song Steve wrote was the best one on the album.I left my copy of the CD in my desk when I quit the job I was working because I knew I wasn't going to listen to it again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17605   I agree with mcrazi8 from Washington's review. I received a call on behalf of my long distance carrier promoting the model 242 2.4 ghz cordless phone. It was hard getting used to my own voice blasting in my ear as I talked as well as the discomfort of the hot battery which ran down very quickly. After about 2 months, my display looked like the dislpay on a calculator that had malfunctioned, with unreadable, and mutated number symbols which finally disappeared all-together. Now it will not hold a charge and I have the same problems attempting to find a replacement battery. 200+ $ later, I'm a very angry customer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
365966  This watch may be comfy and stylish, but unfortunately it will become a dead piece of jewelry (bracelet) when it dies, which it will. The date doesn't reset at the end of the month, you'll have to do this EVERY MONTH and the mechanism will wear out prematurely probably as a result. Even ignoring the date function, when my watch stopped just out of warranty, the cost of repair was greater than new. Movado refuses even the basic courtesies and won't acknowledge the design flaw.There are other choices with decent warrantees. Stick with them, NOT Movado.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
162924  Don't purchase this item. It's plastic with an outside coating of metal. Very cheap and not worth the cost. I purchased another product through a repeatable retailer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
100489  If you already have extensive experience with single veil performance, Petite Jamilla's double veil DVD won't teach you anything that you don't already know. This DVD teaches about ten veil tricks, most of which you can do with a single veil. The tricks that were particular to double veil were ones that any advanced dancer could figure out for herself.For those who are new to veil, this DVD will be fun and enlightening. For those with more advanced technique, I suggest you skip this DVD.

53277   Let me start off by saying I LOVE LOVE LOVE Method products. I use the detergents, all purpose cleaners, wood cleaner, tub and shower cleaner. When my dish soap and dish washer tablets finishes I'll buy the Method brands. The reason I gave this cleaner a 1 star is the smell. I don't mind the smell but its WAY too strong. I'm not a sensitive person but I almost choked spraying half the tub. I sprayed the whole tub, turned on the vent and went about my business for 1 hour. When I peeked my head into the bathroom an hour later I almost passed out! The smell was like I had just sprayed it! So this time I left the door wide open with the vent still on. Less than 10 minutes later my whole apartment smelled like the ylang ylang. I'm never spraying this again. I highly recommend other Method products though!                                                                                                                                     
2521    This book stunk. I believe that reality can have deeper meanings, but don't get to deep or you'll drown. The only time you can go that deep and not drown, is with drugs. I never thought Lord of the Flies would attract so many druggies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
266583  sigh. when i saw this, i wondered how the hell inuyasha could be such crap. it is a phenomanal series, the writing is poor, the plot, and just everything. the 2nd movie was incredible, and the 3rd made me speechless. skip this one, go to the 2nd, than the 3rd. you won't regret this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
155406  I found it dull and at the same time troubling. I never even finished it, and I read a couple of books a week.

355629  This is the sort of singing that drives me nuts. Technically perfect but totally bland like Kraft cheese. Painfully languid tempi. Something you would expect from a top vocal student at a graduating recital. Scared to death of her teacher in case she does something that is not ""quite"" right. Totally senza morbidezza. The Domingo recording of this repertoire is in a totally different higher class.Loved the string quartets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
149248  Do not be fooled by it's memory foam title. I ordered it because I was deceived by the title. Do not make my mistake for memory foam it is not. It is your basic foam punctured with hundreds of holes. I pushed my hand into to see the ""memory"" effect and it quickly popped back into place as soon as I pulled my hand away. My bras from Victoria's Secret have more memory in their foam padding. Don't even get me started on the pillows that come with it. I ended up going to Kohl's and buying a real 3"" memory foam topper that is amazing and actually forms to your body for half off the original price. I paid a bit more but it was well worth it as I know it will last a lot longer than this piece of junk I ordered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
245246  Based on other reviews, I had high hopes for this product. As I share a house with four other girls, it can be difficult to find a time to practice violin when it won't disturb anyone. I was very excited to find an inexpensively priced mute to dampen the sound. I installed it on the bridge of my instrument and ran the bow across the strings... and it sounded exactly the same. I pushed it on a bit tighter, (as tight as I felt I could put it without damaging my bridge) and it started to muffle the sound slightly, but still wasn't a great deal quieter. It seems to destroy tone quality (which was to be expected; it's a practice tool and not for performing) without making much of a difference in volume (which was the disappointment.) At least it was inexpensive, and I'm only out $5.                                                                                                                                                            
262681  This book was the required text for my Humanities class this semester; and may I say that it is a waste of money, time and effort. A more superficial text could not have been willfully created; and at $150.00 new/$80.00 used you are better off dropping the class if you can.If you are interested in the culture and history of ancient civilizations read anything but this book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
245450  It's very hard for me to write this review because I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan. This workout has too much going on! The transitions from walking to running to lunges was too much for me & I consider myself a person with pretty good coordination. I will just stick with Walk & Kick which I enjoy very much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
321410  I only managed 4 chapters. I write this because I disagree with the other negative reviews about the most fundamental problem with the novel. The chapters I read consisted almost entirely of thumbnail biographical sketches of a bunch of characters, none of whom was interesting. The lack of interest was almost beside the point. A novel should not require this much ""set up"" at the onset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
156496  The new version of the diaper genie is a dramatic step backwards. Having had both, I wish I could find the older one either here on Amazon or in a store. The new one jams and shreds the plastic film 3-4 times a week, needing careful work with scissors to salvage it. It cannot be emptied the normal way, again requiring scissors. I wouldn't buy this thing again if you begged me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
37115   My dog could have written a better book.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
12461   Twilight the gayest thing in this world. I'm so tired of these stupid movies. Can't wait for them to end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
333411  I bought this DVD on sale in K-Mart. After watching it for a first time I thru it straight to the garbage. The quality of the DVD was good, but the movie was really bad. It looks like they invested a lot of money to produce this movie. But it does not worth watching even one time. All jokes are silly, and the plot is stupid. The only funny moment was a scene with nuns after they gave away the problem child. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. It does not worth a dime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
30245   If you want a phone that looks good, then this one is for you. But if you're looking for a good phone, this is not the one. The phone locks up every now and then. When it does, I have to turn it off, then on again to use. Also, the joystick is too sensitive, hard to click 1 and get it do what you want it to do.Volume is also too low, can't hardly hear it ring.2 stars for the look only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
359898  These two golden age horror films are done a gross disservice by E-Biz's DVD pressing. Ostensibly struck from 35mm original elements from The National Museum (whoever they are!), what we are given in reality is a scratchy, overly-bright and, most unforgiveably, OUT OF FOCUS, copy of ""Most Dangerous Game""! My public domain Beta copy from 15 years ago looks better than this! The soundtrack is equally poor, filled with loud hiss. ""The Vampire Bat"" fares slightly better; this copy looks no worse than the old pd-videotape copies. At least it's in focus throughout. But this print is NOT complete. My old tape copy runs almost three-minutes longer. My advice is to avoid this disc. ""Game"" is also available on Criterion, so that's the one to buy. This is ""Bat's"" DVD debut, so stick with any of the numerous acceptable tape copies until somebody gets it right on DVD.                                                                             
233450  Like others have said on here before this is NOT an HP product. It is a cheap knock off.It is better as it has an LED indicator but other than that it was much worse then my HP Original charger. This charger got much hotter then a true HP charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking AC to DC conversion very well.Wish chargers would have the 80 Plus standard that most desktops have but they don't. If they did than 80 Plus certified products wouldn't be as warm and you use less energy! I digress...Bottom line: Has an LED indicator. It chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine HP product. It may not last as long as a real charger but I have not tested that out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
355193  This lamp lasted no time. The bottom of the lamp detached from the base within a few months of not even moving the lamp-and bulbs burn out quickly and are expensive for this product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
155406  I found it dull and at the same time troubling. I never even finished it, and I read a couple of books a week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19226   This machine was rediculous. It was returned within 3 weeks. It would constantly ask you to clean the milk unit and run the cleaning cycle every day. If you do not, it builds up mold and mildew. Was a nightmare.The touch screen did not work well either. You press one thing and another function was activated.done with Saeco                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
127742  I have a Golden Retriever and a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. The first time I used this vacuum I was very impressed with the suction - until the agitator belt came off! The very first time I used it, it came off. I looked at the brush roller in the power head and it had lots of dog hair wrapped around it. I'm not sure if that's what made it come off, but it's a pain to repair the belt. Not only do you have to unscrew 3 screws to take the power head cover off, but then unscrew 2 more screws to uncover the roller brush. We have almost all hardwood floors - the belt snapped off when I came to an entryway rug to vacuum and turned on the power to the roller brush.I also did not like the dirt cup. If you have long haired dogs or cats, the quantity of hair being sucked up will fill the cup to the max line very quickly.Needless to say, I wrapped it up and sent it back immediately. I'm ready to shell out some bucks now. On to Meile!!!   
42939   How anyone can take seriously a novel in which the protagonist blows up ""his"" building because it was stolen by the people who paid for it, the people who owned the land and materials, and the workers who constructed it is beyond me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
132095  After one reviewer clamed this album was ""Better than Joy Division! Better than the Smiths!"" I was surprised to find that ""It's a Shame about Ray"" was completely unimpressive music. The Lemonheads are not unique in any way; their music is equivalent to hearing a fly buzz. This album could be a soundtrack to a Dawson's Creek episode. Lyrics are neither appallingly stupid nor heart moving. Anyone playing with Fruity Loops on their P.C. could create a more unique sound than The Lemonheads ""It's a Shame about Ray."" If you like unmoving, unimpressive, downright boring music, this album is for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
233771  Seriously, Microsoft should be ashamed. If any other company had produced something like Vista, they would now be bankrupt. Purchased a laptop that had Vista installed on it. Had troubles from day one. Absolutely could not set up my network. I previously had two computers that ran on XP. They were doing fine on the network. No peripherals work. For the average user, the problems greatly outweigh any benefits Vista has over XP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
70681   The average chapter in this ""book"" is measured in paragraphs, not pages. The story could be a great one, but instead of being a story about racism in the Old South, it is a narcissistic ""look-at-poor-me, nobody-had it-worse-than-me"" fantasy tale. My ten-year-old writes more complex sentences, and is less focused on himself than is the writer of this pity party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
319222  I'm quite disappointed with this video: the routine itself is okay (though nothing outstanding), BUT the instructor P.J.O'Clair (who is not the one on the cover b.t.w.) talks throughout the WHOLE video with about TWICE the speed you'd normally speak with - this was so distracting I couldn't concentrate on the actual yoga at all. I mean, who can do yoga if someone talks to them ALL THE TIME?!I just can not.There is an option on the DVD to just listen to the music, but that didn't make sense for me either as I missed the transitions into the next pose when I wasn't looking at the screen (like in down dog). Additionally the music was enervating as well because it consists of a short piano sequence that is repeated from the beginning to the end of the routine :-(...(and everytime you put the DVD into the player you have to watch the introductory advertisement again!)conclusion: unusable for me & my first and last video from Stott     
326735  Some of the instructions are not very clear. Such as, what time frame can you take the dose, especially if you miss the dose at the time you eat your meal (up to 30 mins. before or 30 mins. after, 1 hr. before, 1 hr. after, etc.). It is not clear on the product or the information that is sent or on the website. When Alli first came out, I went through a screen test on the internet and according to my answers I gave, I was a candidate. However, now, it appears, due to my diet and the amount of weight I need to lose(less than 20lbs), Alli is better left to those who need to lose at least 35lbs or more. I am sticking with it because I think it helps me stay on track with my diet, and I have seen results. However, I cannot say that all of my results are due to Alli.                                                                                                                                                                            
326245  I regretted purchasing the hardbound book from the 3rd page. I found this book barely tolerable to finish. It is saccharine, written like a junior high school love letter, offers no depth or insight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
167064  I don't know what is going on with this packaging tape, but it isn't sticky! I have gone through two rolls wrapping just a few packages because the tape doesn't stick to anything except itself. I don't know what the problem here is, but definitely DO NOT buy this product. I thought it was a fluke, but this is the second time this has happened to me ordering this product!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
162924  Don't purchase this item. It's plastic with an outside coating of metal. Very cheap and not worth the cost. I purchased another product through a repeatable retailer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
240183  I recently purchased this DVD along with Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno. It is exactly the same as the Reno DVD. I didn't need to buy both. Your customers should be aware of this. The Reno DVD is dearer but better quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
362266  This mouse worked well for me relieving pain in my arm and elbow. However the device did not last 3 months with light use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
341494  When I came across this movie two key words caught my attention...1 - vagina... 2 - director's cut...I love Gabriella Hall but this movie is kak...it is a nice idea but again not cleverly executed... lots of nudity but not that erotic...it looked too 'cut' for a directors cut... I did not enjoy the movie...the key words did not do the trick...

The quality are good and will last quite a while.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12508   Excellent album! Tracks mostly from 1950's release ""Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra"" are arranged by George Siravo and Axel Stordahl. ""I've Got a Crush on You"" is my favourite. This album really swings!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
164341  I love the collection! I had never seen the ""A Matter of loaf and Death"" episode. I got this, yesterday, and watched it last night. Plays great. I was a bit disappointed with the format, though. There are 4 discs, each with only one episode on it. I was expecting all 4 episodes on one disc, or at least the original 3 on one, and maybe a separate disc for the ""A Matter of loaf and Death"" episode. All in all, I am happy to finally have this collection on DVD. Seller was great, no issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
155583  For 35$ you can't expect much,I was pleasantly surprised! The Hohner student melodica has a nice tone and is easy to play. It comes with two mouth pieces, one for upright playing, the other for playing flat on a table in front of you, like a piano. I prefer the upright method others may not. It's nice to have a choice. The reason I only gave it four stars is the plastic construction might not be durable with rough use, but for 35$ you can always get another.Hohner Student Melodica (32 Key)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
92163   I have always had a major soft spot for this album, as it was my first encounter with Tull. I still think it is one of the most beautifully crafted releases of the 1970's. Contains one of the best pieces of Tull acoustic (White Duck), one of their heaviest pieces (Minstrel), and then there is the masterpiece, Baker St. Muse which takes the best aspects of their earlier extended pieces and condenses it into 15 minutes. An extremely underrated album from an underrated group!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
377308  I have owned and tried out 5 digicams within 5 years ranging from :1. Nikon Coolpix 800 - First camera, good pix but simply too big, sold on ebay2. Canon S200 - Small, 2megpixels only but good backup camera3. Canon S45 - not small at all but good features, sold on ebay4. Nikon Coolpix 5400 - returned within 1days from Costco because of too complex manual and old technology (introduced 2 years ago)5. Canon SD300 - Smallish and good image and excellent videoWhoever want to be professional, please go get digital SLR. Any so called prosumer digital camera ($400+) is not going to solve your problem. Please ask yourself if you are taking pictures in auto or semi-auto mode 90% of the time or not. If so, any so called features is a joke.This one offers simply but enough features to satisfy you needs. Good picture and excellent video. However, please do not abuse the use of video mode unless you have multi-GB SD card. The video is good but the file size is way tooooooo big.    
304740  You could definitely do worse with 70 minutes than watch this fun Bruce Campbell film. While all the cuts are not nearly as seamless as you may have been led to believe, you don't notice the majority of them. The pace is consistent and well-suited to the plot, and the acting is generally pretty good. If you're a fan of Bruce Campbell, this is definitely a must-see. If you're not, it's still worth a look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
143171  Heavy Duty Safe & Durable Pressure Cooker. I highly recommend this pressure cooker for canning. Its awesome! The canner won't dent and the clamp down lid makes it safer than lower cost versions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
176037  A small innocent looking book. But it is more profound than anything I have ever read before. It speaks to the part of me that has never been satified with any job, relationship or belief system. It offers ultimate freedom.

119569  I remember watching this movie as a child with my father. When my oldest son started to love dinosaurs, I knew he would love this movie too. It's great to share this with him. Delivery was quick too. Thank you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
371360  Of the several types of bibs for my children, ages 6 months through 4 years, the Bumkins brand bibs do the best job of protecting clothes and catching spilled food and drink. The neck strap is velcro and is conveniently located on the side, so you can tighten it as needed. It does a good job for those first-feedings --- when the baby food drips down your baby's neck. I've never had a problem with food or drink spilling underneath of it. The bib is long enough to protect shirts and catch most spills. Because it is made of flexible material, it can fit in between your child and the high chair table.My complaints: yes, they are machine-washable. But if you wash them in the machine, the plastic material will begin to break down and flake off. I hand wash them. Be sure to thoroughly dry them also. If left wet, they put off an awful stench.                                                                                                                                         
375078  This book is on my very short list of ""I wish I had been smart enough to write this book"" books. It is incredibly clever and imaginative. There really is no genre for this book. It is stand alone - in a class of its own. I highly, highly recommend reading it. If I were to write my own recommended reading list, this book would be very near to the top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15453   I was worried because some reviews talked of a part breaking when mixing bread, but further research showed that KitchenAid had fixed that problem. I have owned my KitchenAid for 8 months, made countless whole grain breads and I love it! Had a problem with the dough hook releasing, but called KA and they had me fix it with a drop of oil-and they were so nice. What a great company!

This CD is absolutely fantastic and really is a classic in noisy rock...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
180173  I bought this to replace the rusting one I bought years ago. The drip pan is a bit smaller than my old one and I was concerned about it being a bit top heavy if I tried to cook a large bird with it. I didn`t have any problems but I made sure the wings were tied back and a baking pan was underneath it as well. Clean-up was a snap!!

119675  This cd is my favorite of all the Carpenters albums. It takes me back to the late 60's, early 70's- the way rock n roll radio used to be. Their renditions of the oldies and Richard as the dj are a super mix. If you like the music of that era (American Graffitti, etc.), you won't want to miss this classic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
300881  Ok, this book is short ... just 88 pages but, what a great price! Like so much of kafka's other writings, these stories are surreal, almost like nightmares. The Metamorphasis has much in common with kafka's novel ""The Trial"" in that the main character, a low level white collar worker, wakes up one morning and finds his life has changed. In ""The Trial,"" he wakes up to discover he is under arrest. In ""The Metamorphasis,"" he discovers he has turned into an insect. The reaction of his family is the main thrust of the story and is probably based upon Kafka's own autobiographical insecurities. Another truly surreal story is ""A Country Doctor."" Like in a bad dream, many disturbing events occur and reality changes and becomes distorted. The nightmarish mood Kafka creates is masterful. To be sure, these stories are often hard to truly understand but they are woth reading and pondering. For a rock bottom price, treat yourself to some excellent and very challenging literature.

28913   By ""good"", I mean absolutely hilarious. And by ""clean"", I of course mean not at all clean. Okay, so it's not for the easily offended, but for the rest of us it's a dream come true. I only started reading the web site a year ago, so I've missed a lot of hilarious stories. The Onion is one of the funniest things going, and I hope Volume 2 comes out soon!

339285  I have an ""ancient"" Canon S750 printer I use for printing my year end financial reports. As I use it only once a year, I would expect the ink cartridges to be fresh if purchased a few months prior to expected use of them Thus far I have not had to use them, but will shortly. The problem with any printer ink cartridge is shelf life. I have learned how to extend the life of some of the older cartidges, but as the printer gets older I may have to resort to purchasing a newer one. I commend the price of this brand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
101453  I read much of the original manga to this, but was blown away with the quality and pace of the anime. A great addition to any collection and a good price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
377611  Great translation of the classic CAPCOM fighter. Some small effects are missing(swinging rails on the subway, level transition seens), and the normal NINTENDO censorship(no women thugs). Capcom seems they tried to upgrade the music, but should have kept the original scores. Sound effects are perfect, even better than the SNES, and up to par with the original arcade. Graphics are awesome, Cody, Guy, and Haggar are done well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
75743   This frothy little book features small, easy to follow descriptions of how dinosaurs may have lived and looked. The artwork is quite good and the primary reason I give it four stars. It can serve as a nice way to introduce the young and beginning reader to our favorite extinct animals. Recommended.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
372211  Love this ring, I wear it all the time. This was my first time ordering a ring online and must say it was a great first time! If you like turtles, this is the ring for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
120359  Bought this tripod for my girlfreind's Canon 870 IS, and it works as advertised. It is quite a bit smaller than I thought it was, but in a good way. It would be easy to fit this tripod in a women's purse, along with the camera. It provides fairly firm support for the camera, and has a quick release mechanism for extended tripod work if needed. All in all, a nice accessory for any point-n-shoot camera owner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
140023  This is a fantastic DVD, highly recommended not only to Benigni fans, but also to those interested in a movie that takes a very unusual and personal approach to the defining event of our century. Benigni's direction is uncomplicated but effective--he lets the story do the talking. And while there is plenty of Roberto's vintage slapstick--the schoolroom scene rivals Sellers at his goofball best--the film's triumph is the way Benigni marries comedy with devastating tragedy. Life is Beautiful gloriously celebrates a theme seen throughout Benigni's ouevre: the triumph of kindness, simplicity, and love in the face of cynicism and evil. It is an old-fashioned film in the best sense of the word with solid acting from the supporting cast and a fine musical score to complement Benigni's antics. One of the few ""must haves"" among 1999 releases.                                                                                                                                          
125008  It's funny reading through all these reviews that no one has noticed how much they sound like Maroon 5! In fact, I'd go as far to say that this is a Maroon 5 sound-alike band (even the lead singer's voice).Now don't get me wrong, I love Maroon 5... and I really like this CD. But, you gotta call a spade a spade, and this CD is in no way paving an original path. However, the first few songs on this CD are excellent, and rival anything Maroon 5 has done.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

58   Lamest World Cup song ever! This time FOR Africa? You mean IN Africa. It wasn&39;t a Live Aid event or something. She made it seem like a charity case for them instead of a proud moment. Where was Ricky Martin when you needed him! SMH﻿

296  This song is the most boring, asinine song I have ever heard. Coming from a  guy who liked ""Teenage Dream"" (the song). Ever since Katy Perry's divorce  it's wave after wave of shitty but successful songs... For those of you  saying ""This is the next wave of pop music"". Stick it up your ass. Katy  Perry is like Silly Putty. ﻿

305  Hello everyone :) I know most of you probably pass up these kind of comments, but for those who are still reading this, thanks! I don’t have any money for advertisements, no chance of getting heard, nothing. I live in such a small town... If this comes off as spam, sorry. I’m an instrumental songwriter from Columbus, Mississippi. Please go to my channel and check out my original music. It would be highly appreciated if you thumbs up this comment so my music can be heard!

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

305  Hello everyone :) I know most of you probably pass up these kind of comments, but for those who are still reading this, thanks! I don’t have any money for advertisements, no chance of getting heard, nothing. I live in such a small town... If this comes off as spam, sorry. I’m an instrumental songwriter from Columbus, Mississippi. Please go to my channel and check out my original music. It would be highly appreciated if you thumbs up this comment so my music can be heard! Thank you, Adam Whitney

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

305  Hello everyone :) I know most of you probably pass up these kind of comments, but for those who are still reading this, thanks! I don’t have any money for advertisements, no chance of getting heard, nothing. I live in such a small town... If this comes off as spam, sorry. I’m an instrumental songwriter from Columbus, Mississippi. Please go to my channel and check out my original music. It would be highly appreciated if you thumbs up this comment so my music can be heard! Thank you, Adam Whitney

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

305  Hello everyone :) I know most of you probably pass up these kind of comments, but for those who are still reading this, thanks! I don’t have any money for advertisements, no chance of getting heard, nothing. I live in such a small town... If this comes off as spam, sorry. I’m an instrumental songwriter from Columbus, Mississippi. Please go to my channel and check out my original music.

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE. That&39;s the reason why they also refused to have euro (€) as money

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

305  Hello everyone :) I know most of you probably pass up these kind of comments, but for those who are still reading this, thanks! I don’t have any money for advertisements, no chance of getting heard, nothing. I live in such a small town... If this comes off as spam, sorry.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

This book is set in several time periods and I kept imagining a middle aged Anne-Louise Lambert playing Clare Hammond. Although not essential, If you have never seen it I recommend watching the movie first, for no other reason than it's a classic Australian Movie directed by Peter Weir.

303  im sorry for the spam but My name is Jenny. I go to high school where  everyone dresses fashionable but for me I don't because i need money to buy  cute clothes. I have low self esteem . I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.﻿

209  The britishs called that soccer but you know the true word is football and the US Foot is called rugby. That works like that in EUW ( Germany/ Netherland/ France/ Portugal/ Belgium/ Spain/ ... ) Just because the Britishs don&39;t agree to be like us because they are UNIQUE. That&39;s the reason why they also refused to have euro (€) as money

170  I really love watching football and also I’ve started off making income with out financial risk from acquiring bonus deals. It’s this weird technique where you wager on something with one bookmakers and bet against it on Betfair. You secure the bonus as income . A chap named Jim Vanstone is finding the wagers free on his own website Vanstone Secrets (Google it!). I’ve made about 500 quid thus far. And it is cost-free. I guess the bookies pay him to obtain new consumers, yet this actually works.

I feel that what makes this a good beginner's book is its sense of structure and organization.
