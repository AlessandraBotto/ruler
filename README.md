### <a name='DPBD'></a>What is Data Programming by Demonstration (DPBD)?
The success of machine learning has dramatically increased the demand for high-quality labeled data, as the models used in practice are predominantly supervised and performance depends largely on the quality of the training data.
However, this data is expensive to obtain, and limits the adoption of these technologies outside of resource-rich domains.
